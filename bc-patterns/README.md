# BC Patterns - Discovered Wisdom

This folder contains **discovered patterns and insights** that emerge from analyzing hero business data.

## Philosophy

Rather than prescribing BC patterns upfront, we let them **emerge organically** from building out each hero's complete business context. As we develop multiple heroes' BC data (G/L accounts, posting groups, customers, vendors, items, locations), we'll identify:

- Common account structures across business types
- Reusable posting group strategies
- Multi-location management patterns
- Magical commerce considerations that apply broadly

## Current Status

## Pattern Documentation Guidelines

When documenting a discovered pattern:

1. **Show the evidence** - Reference which heroes exhibit this pattern
2. **Explain the rationale** - Why does this pattern work?
3. **Provide guidance** - How should others apply this pattern?
4. **Note exceptions** - Which heroes diverge from this pattern and why?

## Future Pattern Topics

As hero data is developed, consider documenting patterns for:

- **posting-group-patterns.md** - Common posting group structures and naming
- **multi-location-strategies.md** - How different business models handle locations
- **magical-commerce-gl.md** - G/L account patterns for fantasy business operations
- **service-vs-inventory.md** - How service businesses differ from inventory businesses
- **cross-hero-integration.md** - BC setup patterns for businesses that collaborate
- **guild-management-patterns.md** - How to represent guild relationships in BC
- **preservation-and-quality.md** - Tracking magical preservation across businesses

## Contributing Patterns

When you identify a pattern:

1. Create a new .md file in this folder
2. Use the pattern documentation guidelines above
3. Reference specific hero business files as evidence
4. Keep patterns actionable and practical
