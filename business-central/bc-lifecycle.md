## Aithen Foundrix's Telemetry Insights

Aithen Foundrix, the Alchemist of Insight & Intuition, shares these telemetry insights:

> "The patterns in your telemetry data tell stories that users may never speak aloud. Listen to them carefully."

> "A single performance metric in isolation is merely a number; the correlation between metrics reveals the true narrative."

> "The absence of errors is not the same as presence of quality. Measure not just what breaks, but how well things work when they don't break."

> "The best monitoring systems predict problems before they manifest, giving you time to prevent rather than repair."
