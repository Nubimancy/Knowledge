# Business Central Pipelines

This document outlines DevOps practices, testing strategies, and deployment approaches for Business Central projects, using the Devon Opshard character ("The Buildsmith") as a framing device.

## CI/CD Pipeline Components

### Source Control
- Git-based repository structure
- Branch strategies (main, release, feature branches)
- Commit and merge policies
- PR reviews and quality gates

### Build Automation
- AL compiler integration
- App versioning strategies
- Build validation tests
- Package signing

### Testing Layers
- Unit testing with AL Test Runner
- Integration testing across modules
- Performance testing for critical paths
- Automated UI testing

### Deployment Automation
- Environment promotion strategies
- Tenant-specific deployments
- Rollback mechanisms
- Blue/green deployment approaches

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environments
- Individual developer sandboxes
- Shared development environment
- Feature testing environments

### Testing Environments
- Integration testing environment
- Performance testing environment
- User acceptance testing (UAT)

### Production Environments
- Production instance
- Disaster recovery environment
- Hotfix validation environment

## Testing Approaches

### Automated Testing
- Test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Business process test automation
- Data validation tests
- Performance benchmarks

### Manual Testing
- User experience validation
- Complex scenario testing
- Acceptance testing
- Regression testing

## DevOps Best Practices

### Continuous Integration
- Pre-commit validation
- Automated build checks
- Code quality analysis
- Daily integration builds

### Continuous Delivery
- Automated deployment to test environments
- Deployment verification testing
- Environment configuration as code
- Release notes automation

### Monitoring & Telemetry
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and logging
- Usage analytics
- Proactive alerting

### Security Integration
- Secure coding practices
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Access control validation
- Security compliance checks

## Devon Opshard's Pipeline Wisdom

Devon Opshard, the Chronomancer of Continuous Delivery, offers these insights:

> "Time flows differently in a well-orchestrated pipeline. What takes days manually can be compressed into minutes when your automation artifacts are properly enchanted."

> "Never underestimate the power of a good rollback spell. The ability to return to a known good state is just as important as deploying new features."

> "The best CI/CD pipelines are like well-crafted watches - complex on the inside, but offering simple and reliable functionality to those who depend on them."

> "Test early, test often, and make your tests tell a story about how your application should behave. A good test is a living documentation of intent."
