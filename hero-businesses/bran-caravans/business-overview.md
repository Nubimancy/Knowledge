## Vision & Mission

### Vision
**"Rebuilding trust in trade, one safe delivery at a time."**

After witnessing how The Twilight Plague exploited trade routes to spread devastation, Bran understood that commerce was both vulnerable and essential. His vision: transform dangerous, unreliable trade into safe, predictable commerce that rebuilds confidence and prevents the isolation that could hide future threats.

### Mission
**"Connect the realms through professional logistics that honors both safety and cultural respect."**

Bran leverages his bardic training (cultural understanding, diplomacy, communication) and his Fivefold Oaths fame to create a logistics network that:
- Makes safe delivery the expectation, not the exception
- Navigates complex kingdom politics and cultural commerce rules
- Employs professional standards that restore confidence in trade
- Creates economic interdependence that prevents future conflicts

### The Problem Bran Solves

**Before Caravans of Fortune:**
- Amateur traders: 30-60% cargo loss rate on dangerous routes
- No reliable delivery schedules
- Ignorance of current threats (monsters, bandits, weather)
- Cultural misunderstandings causing trade disputes
- Post-plague suspicion of trade routes
- Economic isolation as kingdoms fear outside contamination

**After Caravans of Fortune:**
- Professional service: 95%+ successful delivery rate
- Scheduled, predictable caravan routes
- Real-time threat intelligence network
- Cultural commerce expertise (Bran's bardic specialty)
- Proves trade can be SAFE (counters post-plague fear)
- Economic recovery through reliable commerce
