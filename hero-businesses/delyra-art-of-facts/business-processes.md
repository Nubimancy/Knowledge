# Delyra's Art of Facts - Business Processes

**Focus:** Operational workflows, pain points, and solutions

---

## Core Business Workflows

### 1. Standard Product Manufacturing
**Trigger:** Inventory replenishment threshold or seasonal production planning

**Process Steps:**
1. Review inventory levels across all 5 shop locations via Nubimancy system
2. Identify replenishment needs by product and location (each shop has different demand profiles)
3. Generate production orders with bill of materials (BOM) for each item
4. Verify material availability: check raw material inventory, order from suppliers if needed
5. Schedule production in pocket dimension workshop (time-accelerated: 1 real day = ~1 week production)
6. Assign work to appropriate work center based on enchantment type and complexity
7. Execute enchanting process: material preparation, enchantment casting, curing/stabilization
8. Quality testing: functional test, dimensional stability test, durability assessment
9. Certification: stamp each item with Art of Facts authentication mark
10. Portal distribution: allocate finished goods to appropriate shop locations via portal network
11. Inventory update across all locations in Nubimancy system

**Pain Points:**
- Production scheduling in pocket dimension requires synchronizing real-world time with accelerated time (what's "urgent" in real time may be "plenty of time" in pocket dimension)
- Material freshness is critical: some enchanting components degrade in dimensional transit or over time
- Quality testing must account for items functioning differently across dimensional boundaries
- Portal distribution requires scheduling portal mage availability
- Each shop location has different demand patterns (Stonegate wants weapons, Nimbuspire wants research tools)
- Dimensional stability of finished items: enchantments created in accelerated time must be stable in normal time

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Multi-planar Work Centers PTE: Time stream workshop management, temporal production scheduling
- Nimbus Manufacturing: Standard production planning, BOM management, work center scheduling
- Portal Shop Management PTE: Cross-dimensional inventory synchronization

### 2. Custom Commission Processing
**Trigger:** Client requests bespoke enchantment at any shop location

**Process Steps:**
1. Client consultation at shop: understand requirements, desired enchantment properties, use case
2. Feasibility assessment: can the requested enchantment be created? What materials are needed?
3. Quote generation: material costs, labor estimate (accounting for time acceleration), complexity premium
4. Client approval and deposit payment
5. Material sourcing: check inventory, order rare materials if needed (may require Bran's Caravans for exotic materials)
6. Commission enters production queue in pocket dimension workshop
7. Prototype creation and client review (for complex commissions)
8. Final production with full quality testing
9. Client notification of completion via magical scroll or shop contact
10. Client pickup at originating shop or portal delivery to preferred location
11. Warranty registration and refresh service scheduling (if applicable)

**Pain Points:**
- Client expectations vs. magical reality (some requests are impossible or impractical)
- Material sourcing for exotic components can take weeks (Bran's Caravans to remote regions)
- Time acceleration means commission "feels" fast to Delyra but client experiences real-world wait
- Communication during production: client wants updates but workshop is in another dimension
- Pricing complexity: each commission is unique, making cost estimation difficult
- Cross-dimensional client consultation: some details are lost when relaying between dimensions

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Nimbus Manufacturing: Custom order management, BOM for bespoke items, production tracking
- Multi-planar Work Centers PTE: Time-synchronized production scheduling with real-world delivery commitments
- Enchantment Refresh Services PTE: Warranty and refresh service setup during commission

### 3. Enchantment Refresh & Renewal
**Trigger:** Client brings item for refresh, or scheduled refresh from service contract

**Process Steps:**
1. Item intake: record item details, original enchantment, current condition, client information
2. Diagnostic assessment: measure remaining enchantment effectiveness, identify degradation patterns
3. Determine refresh approach: simple renewal, enhanced refresh, or full re-enchantment
4. Material requirements: identify components needed for refresh (may differ from original)
5. Quote generation for non-contract clients (service contract clients have pre-agreed pricing)
6. Client approval
7. Refresh execution in pocket dimension workshop (time-critical: some refreshes must happen before enchantment fully degrades)
8. Quality testing: verify refresh effectiveness, ensure no side effects from re-enchantment
9. Certification update: refresh date, new effectiveness rating, next recommended refresh date
10. Client notification and pickup/delivery
11. Service contract update: record refresh, schedule next refresh date

**Pain Points:**
- Each enchantment degrades differently: preservation spells fade gradually, protective wards can fail suddenly
- Rare materials may have changed availability since original enchantment (component scarcity)
- Refresh timing is critical: too early wastes resources, too late may mean complete re-enchantment needed
- Dimensional stability of refresh: re-enchanting in pocket dimension an item created in normal time requires calibration
- Volume management: as Art of Facts sells more items, refresh demand grows geometrically
- Client items have sentimental/practical value: handling and storage require extreme care

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Enchantment Refresh Services PTE: Complex refresh workflow management, material tracking, scheduling
- Multi-planar Work Centers PTE: Dimensional calibration for cross-reality refresh work
- Nimbus Manufacturing: Work center scheduling, material management

### 4. Multi-Location Retail Operations
**Trigger:** Ongoing daily shop operations across 5 portal-connected locations

**Process Steps:**
1. Daily inventory check across all locations via Nubimancy system
2. Shop staff open with location-specific product displays and culturally appropriate presentation
3. Customer service: in-person consultation, product demonstration, custom order intake
4. Sales processing: payment, certification documentation, warranty registration
5. Cross-location inventory lookup: if customer wants item not in current shop, check other locations
6. Portal transfer for cross-location requests (customer can wait or pick up at other location)
7. Authentication service: customers bring items for verification at any location
8. End-of-day reconciliation: sales, inventory adjustments, cash management per location
9. Cross-location inventory rebalancing based on demand patterns
10. Weekly demand reporting per location for production planning

**Pain Points:**
- 5 locations with different cultures, currencies, and customer expectations
- Inventory synchronization across portal-connected shops requires real-time accuracy
- Staff at each location must understand local customs AND Art of Facts standards
- Portal availability for inventory transfers depends on portal mage schedules
- Price consistency vs. local market adaptation (same item, different city economies)
- Currency conversion across multiple kingdoms with different exchange rates
- Cultural presentation: Stonegate customers want rugged displays, Bellharbor wants elegant presentation

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Portal Shop Management PTE: Multi-dimensional retail coordination, cross-shop inventory sync
- Nimbus Manufacturing: Retail inventory management, multi-location tracking
- Nimbus Core: Cultural commerce rules, currency handling, city registry data

### 5. Material Sourcing & Inventory Management
**Trigger:** Production needs, replenishment thresholds, or rare material opportunity

**Process Steps:**
1. Monitor raw material inventory against production plans and safety stock levels
2. Standard materials: reorder from established suppliers via regular purchase orders
3. Rare materials: coordinate sourcing expeditions or purchases through specialized channels
4. Ethically sourced components: order from Weltina's Haven with sustainability certification
5. Incoming material inspection: quality verification, magical potency testing, freshness assessment
6. Dimensional stability check: materials must be stable for pocket dimension storage and use
7. Storage allocation: appropriate preservation (some materials need magical preservation, temperature control)
8. Material tracking: batch tracking with source, quality grade, expiration/potency date
9. Pocket dimension transfer: move materials into workshop as needed for production
10. Waste and byproduct management: responsible disposal of spent enchanting materials

**Pain Points:**
- Rare materials are genuinely scarce (magical components from specific regions with limited supply)
- Material freshness degrades differently in pocket dimension vs. normal reality
- Dimensional transit can affect material properties (some components change when crossing dimensional boundaries)
- Ethical sourcing through Weltina adds cost but is non-negotiable for brand
- Multiple currency and trade regulation handling when sourcing across kingdoms
- Some materials are time-sensitive: must be used within narrow windows after harvesting
- Volcanic materials from Ashford, ice crystals from Frostmere, etc. require climate-controlled transport

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Multi-planar Work Centers PTE: Dimensional stability tracking, cross-reality material management
- Enchantment Refresh Services PTE: Rare material tracking with temporal decay monitoring
- Nimbus Manufacturing: Standard inventory and BOM management, purchase order processing
- Nimbus Core: Multi-realm vendor coordination, cultural commerce rules for cross-kingdom sourcing
