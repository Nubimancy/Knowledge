## Vision & Mission

### Vision
**"A safe pint in every tavern, because the world heals better over good ale."**

The Twilight Plague spread through contaminated food and drink. The resulting terror destroyed trust in communal eating and drinking—the very activities that bind communities together. Thorin saw that taverns were closing, breweries failing, and people retreating into isolation. His vision: rebuild trust in food and drink safety through magical preservation, professional distribution, and quality guarantees that prove shared meals are safe again.

### Mission
**"Deliver quality ales safely to every tavern that wants them, using magical preservation and professional logistics to guarantee what's in the barrel is pure."**

Thorin leverages his clerical training (purification magic, divine blessings), his dwarven brewing heritage, and his Fivefold Oaths fame to create:
- A distribution network delivering ales from quality breweries to taverns across the realms
- Magical preservation systems that keep ale fresh and safe across long distances and climates
- The "Caskwarden Certified" quality mark that tells customers a drink is genuine and pure
- A professional guild of Caskwardens managing regional hubs with consistent standards
- Partnership with Bran's Caravans for the logistics backbone

### The Problem Thorin Solves

**Before Port & Pour:**
- Post-plague paranoia about contaminated food and drink destroying tavern businesses
- No way to verify ale safety after long-distance transport
- Breweries losing customers because distribution was unreliable and untrusted
- Taverns closing because patrons feared communal drinking
- Quality ales from remote breweries couldn't reach distant markets without spoiling
- No cold chain or preservation system for temperature-sensitive brews

**After Port & Pour:**
- "Caskwarden Certified" mark guarantees purity and quality
- Magical preservation keeps ale fresh across any distance and climate
- Professional distribution network connecting breweries to taverns reliably
- Taverns reopening as public trust returns
- Remote specialty breweries reaching new markets
- Post-plague community gathering resuming around trusted shared drinks
