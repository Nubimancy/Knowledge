## Vision & Mission

### Vision
**"Every magical creature deserves to be understood, not just used."**

After watching the post-plague panic drive indiscriminate slaughter of magical creatures for fraudulent "cures" and "protection charms," Weltina realized that the world was destroying irreplaceable species out of fear and ignorance. Her vision: build a conservation institution that proves magical creatures are more valuable alive and protected than dead and sold to charlatans.

### Mission
**"Preserve magical species through ethical stewardship, advance understanding through education, and provide sustainable magical resources that make exploitation unnecessary."**

Weltina leverages her ranger training (creature tracking, habitat knowledge, species behavior) and her Fivefold Oaths fame to create:
- A world-class wildlife preserve with climate-controlled habitats for diverse magical species
- Educational programs that teach people to respect rather than fear magical creatures
- A sustainable harvesting model that provides real magical components without harming species populations
- A network of professional Wardens who ethically source creatures from across the realms
- Research partnerships with academic institutions advancing magical creature knowledge

### The Problem Weltina Solves

**Before Haven Wildlife Preserve:**
- Post-plague charlatan industry driving mass creature slaughter for fake cures
- No distinction between real magical components and fraudulent ones
- Species populations declining from unregulated hunting
- Dangerous creatures left unmanaged, increasing caravan and settlement threats
- No systematic knowledge of magical creature behavior, habitats, or needs
- Ecosystem disruption cascading into unpredictable monster migrations

**After Haven Wildlife Preserve:**
- Professional conservation protecting endangered magical species
- Certified sustainable harvesting providing genuine magical components (partnered with Delyra for authentication)
- Population monitoring and management reducing dangerous encounters
- Educational programs replacing fear with understanding
- Creature migration data shared with Bran's Caravans for route safety
- Research advancing practical knowledge of magical ecology
