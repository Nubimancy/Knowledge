# Weltina's Haven Wildlife Preserve - Business Processes

**Focus:** Operational workflows, pain points, and solutions

---

## Core Business Workflows

### 1. Creature Acquisition & Intake
**Trigger:** Identified need for new species/individual (breeding program, rescue, collection contract)

**Process Steps:**
1. Identify acquisition need: breeding program gap, rescue request from settlement, research requirement, or Warden field discovery
2. Assess species requirements: habitat needs, dietary requirements, social behavior, known health risks
3. Assign qualified Warden team based on species expertise and collection region
4. Warden conducts field assessment: population health, ethical collection feasibility, sustainability impact
5. Collection execution with species-appropriate capture methods (sedation, luring, magical containment)
6. Transport coordination with Bran's Caravans for specialized creature shipping (climate-controlled, stress-minimized)
7. Quarantine intake at Haven: health screening, parasite check, behavioral assessment
8. Habitat assignment based on species needs, social compatibility, and available enclosure space
9. Integration monitoring: stress levels, feeding behavior, interaction with existing creatures
10. Registration in Nubimancy system: species profile, provenance, health baseline, breeding potential

**Pain Points:**
- Each species requires completely different collection, transport, and intake procedures
- Transport conditions vary dramatically (fire creatures need heat, ice creatures need cold, dream creatures need magical containment)
- Quarantine duration varies by species and origin region (unknown diseases from remote areas)
- Social compatibility assessment is complex (some species are territorial, some need groups, some are solitary)
- Warden teams in remote areas have limited communication for real-time guidance
- Ethical collection assessment requires balancing conservation goals with wild population health

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Advanced Creature Care Protocols PTE: Species-specific intake workflows, health tracking from day one
- Nimbus Core: Inter-Realm Communication Hub for Warden field coordination
- Nimbus Exhibition: Project management for acquisition expeditions

### 2. Creature Care & Health Management
**Trigger:** Ongoing daily operations for all creatures in Haven's care

**Process Steps:**
1. Daily health monitoring rounds: visual assessment, feeding behavior, activity levels
2. Species-specific care routines: feeding schedules, enrichment activities, habitat maintenance
3. Veterinary examinations: scheduled check-ups, injury treatment, breeding health assessment
4. Behavioral monitoring: stress indicators, social dynamics, enrichment effectiveness
5. Habitat condition management: temperature, humidity, lighting, terrain maintenance per species needs
6. Breeding program management: mating pair selection, gestation monitoring, offspring care
7. Lifecycle tracking: growth stages, aging indicators, end-of-life care decisions
8. Medical record updates in Nubimancy system after each care interaction
9. Enrichment program rotation: new activities to prevent boredom and promote natural behaviors
10. Species interaction management: coordinating shared spaces for compatible species, separating incompatible ones

**Pain Points:**
- "Living inventory" doesn't behave like traditional inventory (creatures get sick, have moods, reproduce, die)
- Each species has unique care requirements that change with lifecycle stage (juvenile vs. adult vs. elderly)
- Behavioral changes can indicate health issues, stress, or breeding readiness - requires expert interpretation
- Habitat conditions must be maintained precisely (fire creatures die in cold, ice creatures melt in heat)
- Breeding programs require careful genetic tracking to avoid inbreeding
- Staff must be trained in species-specific handling (a technique safe for one species may injure another)
- Nocturnal vs. diurnal species require different staffing schedules

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Advanced Creature Care Protocols PTE: Living inventory system with health, behavior, and lifecycle tracking
- Nimbus Exhibition: Resource scheduling for care staff and veterinary services
- Nimbus Core: Guild coordination for Warden and care staff management

### 3. Sustainable Harvesting & Component Management
**Trigger:** Scheduled harvesting cycle or auction preparation

**Process Steps:**
1. Review sustainability quotas per species per period (set by Weltina with research input)
2. Identify harvestable components: naturally shed materials (scales, feathers, fur), voluntarily produced (venom milking, magical secretions), and byproducts (eggshells, molted skin)
3. Schedule harvesting to minimize creature stress (aligned with natural shedding/production cycles)
4. Execute collection with trained handlers using species-appropriate methods
5. Quality assessment: grade components for potency, condition, and rarity
6. Preservation processing: species-specific storage (some components degrade quickly, some need magical preservation)
7. Provenance documentation: species, individual creature, collection date, method, handler, sustainability certification
8. Inventory registration with full tracking in Nubimancy system
9. Allocation to auction lots, standing orders, or research use
10. Coordinate with Delyra's Art of Facts for authentication certification on premium components

**Pain Points:**
- Harvesting windows are dictated by creature biology, not business convenience (a phoenix sheds feathers on its own schedule)
- Component quality varies by individual creature, season, health status, and stress levels
- Preservation requirements differ dramatically by component type (fire creature scales vs. ice creature crystals)
- Sustainability quotas must balance revenue needs with species health (Weltina always prioritizes species health)
- Tracking provenance from individual creature through to end buyer is complex but essential for certification
- Some components have very short shelf life without magical preservation (expensive)
- Auction timing must align with buyer demand cycles (alchemists need components before crafting seasons)

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Patron Auction Management PTE: Auction coordination, provenance tracking, sustainability certification
- Advanced Creature Care Protocols PTE: Harvesting schedule integration with creature health data
- Nimbus Exhibition: Project management for harvesting cycles

### 4. Educational Program Delivery
**Trigger:** Institutional partnership schedule, visitor booking, or special event

**Process Steps:**
1. Curriculum planning: design age-appropriate and institution-appropriate content per partnership agreement
2. Schedule coordination: align program delivery with creature availability (some creatures are seasonal, nocturnal, or in breeding periods)
3. Safety preparation: brief visitors on creature interaction protocols, prepare safe observation areas
4. Educator assignment: match Haven staff expertise with program content requirements
5. Live creature interaction setup: prepare appropriate creatures for demonstrations (only those comfortable with human interaction)
6. Program delivery: guided tours, lectures, hands-on experiences, research observations
7. Visitor management: group sizes, accessibility needs, cultural considerations per city of origin
8. Post-program assessment: participant feedback, learning outcome measurement
9. Research integration: share relevant findings with educational partners
10. Partnership reporting: deliver impact reports to institutional partners and funding patrons

**Pain Points:**
- Live creatures don't always cooperate with educational schedules (creature may be stressed, sleeping, or in a mood)
- Safety requirements limit which creatures can interact with visitors (and which visitors can interact with creatures)
- Different institutions have different curriculum standards and cultural expectations
- Visitor volume must be balanced with creature welfare (too many visitors stress some species)
- Seasonal creature availability means some programs can only run at certain times of year
- Remote educational partnerships (Glimmerdeep, Frostmere) face significant travel logistics
- Measuring educational impact is difficult (how do you quantify "reduced fear of magical creatures"?)

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Multi-Habitat Management PTE: Educational program integration with creature availability and habitat scheduling
- Nimbus Exhibition: Event management, registration, facility scheduling
- Nimbus Core: Cultural rules for adapting programs to different city customs

### 5. Warden Network Operations
**Trigger:** Collection contract, ecological survey request, or emergency creature incident

**Process Steps:**
1. Receive request: creature collection, relocation, survey, or emergency response
2. Assess requirements: species expertise needed, region, risk level, equipment
3. Assign Warden team: match expertise, availability, and regional knowledge
4. Mission briefing: target species, collection area, sustainability quotas, safety protocols
5. Field operations: travel to site, assess conditions, execute mission (collection, survey, or relocation)
6. Field reporting: regular updates via magical scroll communication (when available)
7. Transport coordination: arrange Bran's Caravans or specialized transport for acquired creatures
8. Mission completion: debrief, performance assessment, expense reporting
9. Data submission: field observations, population estimates, habitat condition reports
10. Intelligence sharing: creature migration data to Bran's Caravans, territorial warnings to settlements

**Pain Points:**
- Wardens operate in remote, dangerous regions with limited communication
- Each mission has unique species and environmental challenges (fire region vs. ice region vs. swamp)
- Performance tracking is difficult when Wardens work independently across vast territories
- Ethical compliance monitoring is challenging at a distance (ensuring Wardens follow sustainability protocols)
- Emergency response requires rapid deployment but Wardens may be days away
- Warden safety in dangerous wilderness (monsters, bandits, environmental hazards)
- Contract management with sustainability quotas that vary by species and region

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Multi-Habitat Management PTE: Warden guild coordination, territory management, compliance tracking
- Nimbus Core: Communication protocols for field coordination, guild management
- Nimbus Exhibition: Service project management for missions
