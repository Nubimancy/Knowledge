# Consulting vs. Product Models: VAR vs. ISV Approaches

This document compares the two primary business models in the Business Central ecosystem: Value-Added Resellers (VARs) focusing on consulting services and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) focusing on product development.

## Business Model Overview

### VAR Model (Consulting)
The VAR approach focuses on delivering tailored solutions for individual customers, with revenue primarily from implementation services, customization, and ongoing support.

### ISV Model (Product)
The ISV approach focuses on building standardized software products that can be sold to multiple customers with minimal customization, with revenue primarily from license sales and maintenance fees.

## Business Model Comparison

| Aspect | VAR (Consulting) Model | ISV (Product) Model |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Revenue** | Implementation services, customization, support | Product licenses, subscription fees |
| **Scalability** | Linear (tied to consultant capacity) | Exponential (product can be sold repeatedly) |
| **Profit Margins** | Lower margins, higher volume | Higher margins, especially at scale |
| **Development Focus** | Custom solutions for specific clients | Reusable components for multiple clients |
| **Risk Profile** | Lower upfront investment, steady cashflow | Higher upfront investment, delayed return |
| **Market Reach** | Usually regional/local | Potentially global |
| **Resource Needs** | More consultants and project managers | More developers and product specialists |

## Key Success Factors

### VAR Success Factors
- Strong methodology and process consistency
- Excellent client relationship management
- Efficient resource allocation and utilization
- Clear scoping and change management procedures
- Deep vertical industry knowledge
- Strong technical delivery capability

### ISV Success Factors
- Product vision and market fit
- User experience design excellence
- Scalable architecture and code quality
- Efficient development processes
- Effective marketing and sales channels
- Strategic roadmap planning
- Customer-driven feature prioritization

## Hybrid Approaches

Many successful organizations combine elements of both models:

### VAR-to-ISV Evolution
1. Identify repeatable solutions built for clients
2. Standardize and package these solutions
3. Begin offering standardized solutions to new clients
4. Gradually shift from custom work to product implementation
5. Eventually develop true multi-tenant offerings

### ISV with Services
1. Core product offering provides the foundation
2. Implementation services ensure proper adoption
3. Custom development for specific needs
4. Higher-tier support packages for premium clients
5. Development services for extensions to core product

## Organizational Structure Differences

### VAR Organization
- Project-based team structure
- Customer success managers
- More functional consultants
- Higher ratio of consultants to developers
- More generalists who understand multiple areas

### ISV Organization
- Product-focused team structure
- Product managers for feature prioritization
- Higher ratio of developers to consultants
- More specialists in specific technical areas
- Dedicated support and documentation teams

## Business Metrics Differences

### VAR Metrics
- Billable utilization
- Project profitability
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Time to value
- Recurring revenue percentage

### ISV Metrics

## Strategic Recommendations

### For VAR Organizations
1. Document and standardize repeatable processes
2. Develop reusable components and accelerators
3. Consider productizing common custom solutions
4. Focus on industry specialization
5. Build value-added IP on top of standard implementations

### For ISV Organizations
1. Maintain focus on core product functionality
2. Build strategic partnerships with VARs for implementation
3. Develop clear extension points for customization
4. Establish customer advisory boards for feedback
5. Balance innovation with stability and compatibility
