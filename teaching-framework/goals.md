# Goals Framework

The Nubimancy project uses fantasy storytelling as a vehicle to teach real-world technical skills and concepts. This document outlines our teaching goals and the structural approach to achieving them.

## Core Educational Philosophy

The Nubimancy project is built on several key educational principles:

1. **Narrative-Based Learning** - Using storytelling to create memorable contexts for complex concepts
2. **Metaphor as Teaching Tool** - Translating technical concepts into fantasy analogies to reduce intimidation
3. **Applied Learning** - Focusing on practical applications rather than abstract concepts
4. **Community Reinforcement** - Building a community of practice where peers learn from each other
5. **Progressive Discovery** - Layering concepts from simple to complex as learners advance
