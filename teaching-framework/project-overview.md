# Nubimancy & The Heroes' Craft

## Premise

**"Nubimancy & The Heroes' Craft"** is a creative and educational initiative that uses a whimsical fantasy setting to teach real-world digital cloud technologies. The project leverages storytelling and worldbuilding to make complex technical concepts more accessible and engaging.

### üå©Ô∏è Project Name & Theme
- **Nubimancy**: A playful take on "cloud magic," derived from Latin *nubes* (cloud) + *-mancy* (magical practice).
- **Full Title**: *Nubimancy & The Heroes' Craft* ‚Äî combining fantasy storytelling with skill-building and collaboration.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Story Framework
- A legendary adventuring party has retired and is now building businesses in a floating city governed by arcane wizards.
- The wizards (called **The Aethernet Assembly**) mentor the heroes and involve student volunteers, blending mentorship with training.

### üéì Educational Purpose
The fantasy world is a vehicle to teach Business Central partner operations. It is also a vehicle to teach use of supporting tools like:
- Microsoft Entra
- Azure DevOps
- Copilot Studio
- Teams, SharePoint, Office
- AI Foundry, App Registrations, and more

## Project Goals

We aim to:
- **Make Technology Learning Enjoyable** - Using storytelling to reduce the intimidation factor of complex cloud technologies
- **Create Practical Learning Materials** - Developing tutorials and guides that use our fantasy framework to explain real-world applications
- **Build a Community of Practice** - Bringing together professionals and enthusiasts to share knowledge in a unique, creative environment
- **Bridge Technical and Business Understanding** - Helping technical and non-technical people communicate better through shared metaphors

## Current Status

As of October 2025, we have completed the foundation-building phase and are transitioning into the core technical development work. The fantasy framework is established and now serves as the narrative wrapper for demonstrating real-world Microsoft partner ecosystems.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Establish core world concepts and magical systems
- ‚úÖ Launch project website and community platforms
- ‚úÖ Develop initial lore documents and world bible
- ‚úÖ Create knowledge repository structure
- ‚úÖ Set up version control, documentation sites, and project infrastructure

### Phase 2: Business Central Extension Ecosystem üîÑ (Current - Q4 2025)

The core technical deliverable: building a complex, interconnected Business Central extension ecosystem that demonstrates real-world partner solution development.

- üîÑ Develop multiple Business Central extensions that work together
- üîÑ Create demo dataset to populate the BC ecosystem
- üîÑ Demonstrate multi-app AL development patterns
- üîÑ Show integration patterns between BC apps
- üîÑ Document extension architecture using the fantasy narrative

**Teaching Focus**: AL development, BC extension patterns, multi-app ecosystems, data modeling

### Phase 3: Integration & Advanced Tooling ‚è±Ô∏è (Q1-Q2 2026)

Expanding the ecosystem with modern DevOps practices, AI tools, and platform integrations that BC partners actually use.

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Azure DevOps**: Project management, CI/CD pipelines, code governance, release management
- ‚è±Ô∏è **M365 Copilot Integrations**: AI-assisted workflows in the Microsoft 365 workspace
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Copilot Studio & Vibe Coding**: AI-assisted development workflows and custom copilots
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Azure Platform & AI Tools**: Cloud infrastructure, Azure AI Foundry, app registrations
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Power BI**: Analytics, reporting, business intelligence dashboards
- ‚è±Ô∏è **End-to-End Partner Ecosystem**: All tools working together in realistic scenarios

**Teaching Focus**: DevOps for BC partners, AI integration, Azure services, modern development workflows

### Phase 4: Community & Continuous Learning ‚è±Ô∏è (Ongoing)

- ‚è±Ô∏è Publish tutorials, guides, and learning materials using the fantasy framework
- ‚è±Ô∏è Host workshops and mentorship opportunities
- ‚è±Ô∏è Create interactive learning experiences
- ‚è±Ô∏è Build community contribution framework
- ‚è±Ô∏è Expand narrative elements to support new technical topics

### The Approach

The Nubimancy project teaches complex Microsoft technologies through **practical demonstration**. Rather than abstract tutorials, we build a **fully functional partner ecosystem** using the same tools and practices that real BC partners use. The fantasy narrative makes this engaging and memorable, but the code, configurations, and integrations are all real and reusable.

Each hero's business in the fantasy world maps to actual Business Central modules and Microsoft services. The Aethernet Assembly's operations demonstrate DevOps and platform management. The challenges they face reflect real partner scenarios‚Äîmaking the learning immediately applicable.
