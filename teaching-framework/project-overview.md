# Nubimancy & The Heroes' Craft

## Premise

**"Nubimancy & The Heroes' Craft"** is a creative and educational initiative that uses a whimsical fantasy setting to teach real-world digital cloud technologies. The project leverages storytelling and worldbuilding to make complex technical concepts more accessible and engaging.

### üå©Ô∏è Project Name & Theme
- **Nubimancy**: A playful take on "cloud magic," derived from Latin *nubes* (cloud) + *-mancy* (magical practice).
- **Full Title**: *Nubimancy & The Heroes' Craft* ‚Äî combining fantasy storytelling with skill-building and collaboration.

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Story Framework
- A legendary adventuring party has retired and is now building businesses in a floating city governed by arcane wizards.
- The wizards (called **The Aethernet Assembly**) mentor the heroes and involve student volunteers, blending mentorship with training.

### üéì Educational Purpose
The fantasy world is a vehicle to teach Business Central partner operations. It is also a vehicle to teach use of supporting tools like:
- Microsoft Entra
- Azure DevOps
- Copilot Studio
- Teams, SharePoint, Office
- AI Foundry, App Registrations, and more

## Project Goals

We aim to:
- **Make Technology Learning Enjoyable** - Using storytelling to reduce the intimidation factor of complex cloud technologies
- **Create Practical Learning Materials** - Developing tutorials and guides that use our fantasy framework to explain real-world applications
- **Build a Community of Practice** - Bringing together professionals and enthusiasts to share knowledge in a unique, creative environment
- **Bridge Technical and Business Understanding** - Helping technical and non-technical people communicate better through shared metaphors
