## Overview

This document defines the cultural and operational context for combat sports in Nubimancy. Rini Glar's businesses (RiniDimensionalTournamentBrackets, RiniFighterProgressionAnalytics, RiniMultiRealmSportsBroadcasting) depend on a rich understanding of arena types, combat traditions by kingdom, fighter culture, and the sports broadcasting industry.

Rini's founding insight is that violence was going to happen regardless — veterans of the plague war with nowhere to put their energy, young warriors raised in crisis with no peacetime path forward. The Pinnacle League didn't invent combat sports; it legitimised them. The arenas existed before Rini. The traditions existed before Rini. What she brought was structure, safety, career paths, and a reason for a fighter to still be alive at forty.

Each arena in the League was deliberately chosen to be in, and of, its host culture. The Sunken Ring is Virellian. Underhelm is dwarven. Blackwoods is Cindralis forged. Wavebreaker belongs to the Siroccane desert. The Peak belongs to no one — and everyone.

## Arena Types

### By Physical Setting

The Pinnacle League recognises six arena classifications in its rules codex. Rini's five arenas span four of them; the fifth (Guild Pit) and sixth (Underground) represent the wider industry context the League operates within.

#### Grand League Arena
The Pinnacle League's own venues — purpose-built, environmentally unique, and designed around cultural identity rather than generic combat. Each is the most significant combat venue in its region.

| Arena | Location | Setting | Distinctive Feature |
|-------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **The Sunken Ring** | Bellharbor, Virellia | Floating sea platforms with water hazards | Tidal-shift mechanics; platform configuration changes between rounds |
| **Underhelm** | Helm's Call, Underhelm | Underground crystal cavern | Bioluminescent lighting; echo acoustics; confined space with crystal pillar obstacles |
| **Blackwoods** | Ashford, Cindralis | Volcanic forge arena with active vents | Heat zones mapped to combat rings; fire hazard escalation as fight progresses |
| **Wavebreaker** | Akran, Siroccane | Mobile desert arena; partially open-air | Sand floor; retractable windbreak walls; can operate while the caravan city moves |
| **The Peak** | Mountain summit, portal access only | High-altitude open platform | Wind as an active environmental factor; altitude effects on stamina; no fixed audience seating — patrons stand at perimeter |

#### City Arena
Permanent mid-tier combat venues operated by city authorities or merchant guilds. Common in larger cities; primarily host local and regional circuits that feed into the Pinnacle League qualification structure. Rini has formal partnerships with city arenas in Goldentarn, Thalassor, and Nimbuspire for qualifier events.

#### Guild Pit
Private arenas owned and operated by combat guilds. Access is invitation or membership only. Guild Pits predate the Pinnacle League by centuries and have their own rulebooks and traditions. Rini treats Guild Pits respectfully — they are the traditional talent pipeline, and antagonising them would be counterproductive. Several Guild Pit champions have graduated into Pinnacle League careers.

#### Dimensional Arena
Pocket-dimension combat venues. Currently rare and theoretically possible, but no commercial Dimensional Arena exists in the known world at AC 2247. The Aetheros Magocracy has conducted experimental bouts in pocket spaces; these remain academic curiosities, not commercial venues. *Potential future expansion vector for Rini if Delyra's pocket dimension technology becomes more accessible.*

#### Open-Air Ring
Temporary or semi-permanent festival fighting structures. High attendance, lower prestige. The Pinnacle League sponsors Open-Air Ring events at city festivals as talent scouting and community outreach — the entry point of the pipeline, not the destination.

#### Underground Arena
Informal fighting venues in grey-to-illegal legal status depending on kingdom. Active in Fenroth, Bramblewyn, and parts of Siroccane where regulation is minimal. Rini has a nuanced stance: she does not endorse Underground Arenas and the League will not sanction events there, but she recognises they exist, tracks fighters who come out of them, and offers a clear on-ramp to legitimacy through local Open-Air events.

### By Environmental Profile

Environmental profile is the second classification axis — used primarily for fighter training planning, equipment regulations, and broadcast production requirements.

| Profile | Description | Pinnacle League Arenas | Key Hazard Considerations |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Aquatic** | Combat on or near water; balance and buoyancy central | The Sunken Ring | Drowning risk (managed); platform displacement; wet weapon grip |
| **Underground/Enclosed** | Limited sightlines; confined movement; echo and acoustic effects | Underhelm | Disorientation from sound; dust and crystal particle inhalation; no weather variation |
| **Elemental: Fire** | Active heat sources; fire hazard zones; smoke | Blackwoods | Heat exhaustion; burn risk; reduced visibility in heavy smoke; armour heat retention |
| **Desert/Wind** | Sand underfoot; dust; dehydration; wind gusts | Wavebreaker | Sand in eyes and armour; unpredictable footing; hydration management between rounds |
| **Altitude/Exposure** | Thin air; wind; cold; open space | The Peak | Stamina reduction from altitude; wind throws; cold exposure in waiting periods |
| **Standard** | Neutral terrain, level surface, no environmental hazards | City Arenas, Open-Air Rings | Equipment standard only; no special protocols required |

---

### Arena Safety and Risk Ratings

Every Pinnacle League venue is formally rated on two axes: **Environmental Risk** (the baseline danger of the physical environment) and **Safety Compliance** (how well that risk is managed). The League publishes these ratings; fighters have the right to review before contracting into an arena-specific event.

**Environmental risk classification:**

| Level | Definition | Typical Arenas |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Low** | No significant environmental hazards beyond standard combat; minor weather exposure possible | City Arenas, Open-Air Rings, Underhelm (controlled) |
| **Medium** | Active environmental factors that require adaptation; some elevated injury risk | The Sunken Ring, Wavebreaker |
| **High** | Serious environmental hazards requiring significant safety management; elevated mortality risk without protocols | Blackwoods, The Peak |
| **Extreme** | Conditions that would be life-threatening without active enchantment and medical support | No Pinnacle League venue is rated Extreme; this applies to unregulated events |

**Safety compliance requirements by risk level:**

| Risk Level | Medical Staff | Safety Enchantments | Fighter Medical Clearance | Environmental Controls |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Low | 1 healer stationed at venue | Basic ward (prevents spectator injury) | Standard fitness cert | None required |
| Medium | 2 healers + 1 senior healer | Tier 2 arena safety ward; emergency extraction point | Standard + environment-specific fitness | Pre-event environmental inspection |
| High | Full medical team (3+ healers); Delyra-maintained Tier 3 arena ward | Tier 3 arena safety system; Delyra-installed and maintained | Full physical assessment; environment adaptation certification | Active monitoring during bouts; environmental escalation cut-offs |

**Required safety rituals by arena type:**

- **The Sunken Ring:** Pre-event tide assessment; platform structural check; fighter water-safety certification required (all combatants must pass a basic aquatic survival test); "platform lock" protocol if weather deteriorates mid-event
- **Underhelm:** Crystal-pillar stability inspection before each event day; acoustic calibration check (prevents disorienting resonance buildup); dust management between bouts; emergency lighting backup if bioluminescence disrupted
- **Blackwoods:** Vent activity assessment 48 hours before event; heat zone mapping and marking on arena floor; mandatory hydration monitoring between rounds; fire suppression ward tested before gates open
- **Wavebreaker:** Wind assessment before each bout; sand depth uniformity check; dehydration monitoring protocols; structural integrity check on mobile components if arena has been in transit
- **The Peak:** Altitude acclimatisation requirement (fighters must arrive 3+ days early); wind forecast review before each bout; cold exposure protocol if temperature drops below threshold; portal reliability confirmation before portal-only access events

**Cultural attitudes toward fighter injury and mortality:**

The Pinnacle League introduced formal safety standards into an industry where fatality was previously considered an acceptable, even celebrated, outcome. This required negotiation with each arena's host culture:

- **Virellian attitude (The Sunken Ring):** Spectacle and drama matter; audience does not want sanitised combat; near-drowning moments are considered highlight-reel material — but actual fatality is frowned upon as a diplomatic embarrassment. Rini's approach: high-drama safety (dramatic rescue is part of the show)
- **Dwarven attitude (Underhelm):** Deep respect for fighter honour; yielding is culturally acceptable and respected, not shameful; a fighter who yields rather than die is considered wise, not weak. This aligns well with Rini's safety standards; Underhelm is the League's lowest-fatality venue
- **Cindralis attitude (Blackwoods):** Meritocratic — if you can handle the heat, you earn respect; if you cannot, you should not have entered. Pre-League Blackwoods had the highest fatality rate of any major venue in the region. Rini's intervention was controversial; buy-in came after demonstrating that fighter longevity means better long-term competition quality
- **Siroccane attitude (Wavebreaker):** Combat as trial of survival skill, not entertainment; yielding is a form of wisdom in a culture where unnecessary death is wasteful. Very compatible with Rini's safety philosophy; easiest cultural negotiation
- **The Peak:** No host culture; Rini sets the rules entirely. The invitation-only nature means every attendee has accepted the League's standards as a condition of access

## Combat Traditions by Kingdom and Culture

### Dwarven Combat Traditions

**Primary setting:** Underhelm  
**Cultural significance:** Combat is an expression of the dwarven values of endurance, precision, and honour. The dwarven concept of **"stonewill"** — the internal quality that determines whether you hold position under pressure — is assessed in combat. A fighter who yields when genuinely outmatched demonstrates stonewill; a fighter who continues past the point of all capability demonstrates recklessness, which is disrespected.

**Preferred styles:**
- **Shield and hammer:** The dominant dwarven martial form; emphasis on defence and controlled positional pressure rather than explosive aggression; fights at Underhelm tend to be longer than at other venues
- **Grappling (Deepgrasp):** Dwarven grappling tradition developed in the close confines of underground tunnels; prioritises leverage and joint control; devastating in confined spaces
- **Mountain stance striking:** Heavy, deliberate strikes rather than combinations; power economy over speed; sustainable for the long bouts dwarven tradition favours

**Cultural rules and honour codes:**
- **The Yield Protocol:** Fighters explicitly acknowledge defeat with a fist placed on the arena floor; this ends the bout and both fighters are expected to clasp forearms afterward
- **No striking after the yield signal:** Continuing to strike after an opponent signals yield is the single greatest dishonour in dwarven combat culture; fighters who violate this are banned from Underhelm permanently
- **Pre-bout declaration:** Fighters traditionally state their hold of origin before a bout; Helm's Call dwarves take note of whose fighters perform well as a matter of clan reputation
- **Forbidden techniques:** Eye strikes; attacks on a fighter's tool-hand (the dominant hand used for craft work outside combat); attacks after a fighter loses their footing and is grounded in the grappling zone

**Ritual:**
- Brief stone-striking salute at the start of each bout (both fighters tap their armoured forearms together)
- Post-event the arena's **Remembrance Stone** is updated with the event record — a crystalline ledger inscription that has been maintained continuously since the arena was built; Rini considers this one of the most important traditions in the League and has invested in its preservation

---

### Elven Combat Traditions

**Primary context:** No dedicated Pinnacle League arena in an elven city, but elven fighters participate most actively through The Sunken Ring and The Peak  
**Cultural significance:** Elves largely treat combat as a discipline and a scholarly practice, not primarily entertainment. Elven fighters in the League tend to be outliers in their own culture — drawn to competition for personal reasons — rather than cultural ambassadors. The Sylvaran forest communities actively discourage participation in commercial combat sports. Aetheros elves are more permissive.

**Preferred styles:**
- **Arc-blade forms:** Flowing, circular blade technique emphasising redirection of force rather than head-on collision; extremely effective against heavier fighters
- **Precision archery (exhibition events only):** Distance archery-based competition events at The Sunken Ring; not used in melee bouts; popular diplomatic spectacle events
- **Magical augmentation:** Elves with any magical ability may apply minor personal enhancement magic to themselves during bouts — this is legal under Pinnacle League rules for Low-tier magical effects but requires pre-bout declaration

**Cultural attitudes:**
- Elven audiences attend for the artistry, not the brutality; a technically perfect loss is more respected than a sloppy win
- Elven combat culture considers extended bouts without decisive action a form of mutual respect, not stalling — this sometimes creates tension with human audiences who want faster resolution
- Post-bout analysis and technique discussion is expected; fighters who refuse to discuss how they lost are considered poor sportsmanship

**Restrictions in mixed competitions:**
- Elven arc-blade forms require modified weapons (reduced cutting edge) in events with non-elven participants who are not trained to defend against the technique — required disclosure rule, not outright restriction
- Magical augmentation above Tier 1 is prohibited in all standard bouts; assessed by the event's officiating enchanter before each bout with declared fighters

### Human Kingdom Variations

Human combat culture varies more dramatically by kingdom than any other group. The Pinnacle League navigates this deliberately, treating each arena city's human culture as distinct.

**Virellian (The Sunken Ring):**
- Pragmatic and performance-aware; spectacle matters to the audience
- Fighter-as-celebrity culture more developed here than anywhere else; fighters become social figures, attend diplomatic events, receive noble patronage
- Commercial combat sports are oldest and most organised in Virellia; Rini built on existing infrastructure rather than starting from scratch
- Gambling is legal and culturally embedded in Virellian fight culture; the Sunken Ring's betting odds are quoted in the same breath as the fight itself

**Cindralis (Blackwoods):**
- Meritocratic; results matter more than style; a pragmatic ugly win is respected over a beautiful loss
- Fighters from Ashford and Ironmere tend toward heavy-armour styles that absorb the heat environment; industrial aesthetic (armour incorporating forge-craft elements is common here)
- Cindralis has the most developed mid-tier city arena circuit outside Virellia; regional qualifier infrastructure is strong
- Gambling exists but is more restricted publicly; private wagering between guilds is common and largely unregulated

**Aurumvale (cross-arena; no dedicated arena):**
- Most commercially sophisticated patron class; Aurumvale merchants are the dominant source of fighter sponsorship income across all arenas
- Aurumvale fighters are less common as competitors but prominent as organizers, agents, and patron intermediaries
- Strong demand for clean, documented fight records — Aurumvale merchants want to sponsor proven commodities

**Siroccane (Wavebreaker):**
- Combat as survival tradition rather than entertainment; the audience at Wavebreaker is the smallest of the five arenas but the most intensely engaged
- Individual fighter stories matter enormously to Siroccane audiences — the narrative of how a fighter survived and grew; broadcast rights are least valuable here but fighter loyalty is highest
- No commercial gambling culture; wagering takes the form of nomadic honour bets (public commitments with social rather than financial stakes)

**Most commercially developed combat sports regions:**
- **Virellia** (first mover; most mature; highest broadcast revenue)
- **Cindralis** (strongest internal development circuit; most fighters per capita)
- **Aurumvale** (most money; least fighters; biggest patron class)

---

### Multiplanar Fighters

A small but prestigious category. Multiplanar fighters bring combat traditions from non-standard cultural and physiological backgrounds, and their presence in the League is one of its most discussed aspects — both celebrated and complicated.

**Current multiplanar fighter types active in the League:**
- **Deep-realm dwarven variants** (from isolated holds; physiology larger and heavier than surface dwarves; classified into a specialised weight division)
- **Half-orc fighters** (including Rini herself as the foundational example; highly respected; combination of human adaptability and orcish physical advantage; most integrated group)
- **Planar-touched individuals** (fighters who carry magical effects from dimensional exposure; require pre-bout enchantment health assessment to ensure no unintended passive magical effects during competition)

**Classification challenges:**
- Height and mass do not translate cleanly across species for weight-class purposes; the League uses a **Combat Effectiveness Rating (CER)** as a secondary classification tool alongside raw mass — accounts for reach, natural armour, regenerative capability, and inherent magical resistance
- Fighters who fall between standard brackets may compete in the adjacent higher bracket by consent or request a special classification review from the League's officiating panel

**Cultural sensitivity requirements:**
- Event programmes include fighter background context for multiplanar competitors when the fighter consents to disclosure
- Officiating teams for events with multiplanar fighters include at least one cultural consultant familiar with the fighter's tradition
- Rini's personal reputation as a half-orc who built the League from scratch is the single most powerful factor in multiplanar fighter recruitment; she is proof the system works for them

## Fighter Classification and Progression

### Weight and Combat Class System

The Pinnacle League dual-classifies fighters by **Mass Division** and **Combat Style**, allowing meaningful matchmaking that respects both physiology and tradition.

**Mass Divisions:**

| Division | Mass Range | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Featherweight** | Under 65 kg | Speed-focused bouts; arc-blade and evasion styles dominant |
| **Middleweight** | 65–90 kg | Most populated division; broadest style diversity |
| **Heavyweight** | 90–120 kg | Power and endurance focus; longer bout average |
| **Grand Division** | Over 120 kg / CER-adjusted | Includes large multiplanar fighters; special scheduling |
| **Open Class** | Cross-division exhibition | Used for championship showcase events; top-ranked fighters from all divisions |

**Combat Style Categories** (self-declared; reviewed by officiating panel):

| Style | Description | Typical Mass Division |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Blade** | Primary weapon: single or dual edged; includes arc-blade forms | Featherweight–Middleweight |
| **Blunt** | Primary weapon: hammer, mace, staff | Middleweight–Heavyweight |
| **Shield & Weapon** | Defence-first paired fighting | Middleweight–Grand |
| **Grapple** | Throws, joint locks, ground control; no primary weapon | All divisions |
| **Ranged** | Archery and thrown weapon specialisation (exhibition events only) | Open Class exhibitions |
| **Unarmoured** | No armour; speed and evasion primary | Featherweight–Middleweight |
| **Mixed** | No declared primary; reviewed for bracket placement | All divisions |

---

### Fighter Ranks and Career Stages

The Pinnacle League career ladder gives fighters something no previous system offered: a documented professional trajectory with clear advancement criteria.

| Rank | Name | How Achieved | Rights and Privileges |
|------|------|-------------|----------------------|
| 0 | **Aspirant** | Completes intake assessment and fitness certification | Can enter Open-Air Ring qualifier events; access to basic League training resources |
| 1 | **Novice** | Wins or finishes competitively in 3 qualifier events | Can enter City Arena circuit events; eligible for entry-level sponsorship |
| 2 | **Journeyman** | Top-3 finish in a City Arena sanctioned event | Can enter Grand League Arena events; eligible for fighter representation contracts; basic appearance fee guaranteed |
| 3 | **Veteran** | 10+ Grand League Arena bouts with winning record OR arena-specific championship win | Preferred scheduling access; higher appearance fee tier; eligible for cross-arena events |
| 4 | **Champion** | Current title-holder for a specific arena and weight division | Named title belt; peak appearance fees; The Peak qualification eligibility; broadcaster interview rights |
| 5 | **Legend** | Retirement with Hall of Fame nomination; 3+ championship holds OR extraordinary career record | Permanent honorary League status; mentorship eligibility; broadcast commentary rights; Hall of Fame entry (maps to `62-hall-of-fame-entries.csv`) |

**Hall of Fame eligibility and induction:**
- Nominations are submitted by arena Wardens (Rini's arena managers) or by fighter petition
- A panel of current Champions and League officials votes annually
- Induction ceremony is held at The Peak during the championship event
- Hall of Fame entries receive a permanent crystal record in the Underhelm Remembrance Stone and a named trophy at The Peak

---

### Fighter Contracts and Representation

**How fighters contract with the League:**
- Fighters register through any League-affiliated intake point (any Grand Arena or City Arena partner)
- Registration fee: 5 AC (waived for fighters coming through Rini's free community outreach events)
- Annual participation fee: 12 AC/year (covers insurance, medical access, and training facility access)
- Event participation is contracted per-event for Novice and Journeyman; Veteran and above may hold season contracts

**Guild representation:**
- The **Fighters' Compact** is the informal guild structure that pre-dates the League; Rini negotiated a formal recognition agreement — the League acknowledges Compact membership, and the Compact recommends the League as the legitimate career pathway
- Fighters may retain Compact membership alongside League registration; the structures are complementary
- Independent agents (fighter representatives) began emerging as the League grew; currently unregulated but Rini is developing a voluntary agent accreditation programme

**Appearance fees and prize money by tournament tier:**

| Event Tier | Participation Fee (AC) | Winner Prize (AC) | Runner-Up (AC) | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Open-Air Qualifier | Free | 8–15 | 3–8 | Talent scouting events; Rini subsidises prize pool |
| City Arena Sanctioned | 3 | 40–80 | 15–35 | Host city co-funds |
| Grand Arena Regular Season | 10 | 150–300 | 60–120 | Broadcast revenue share included |
| Grand Arena Championship | 15 | 500–1,200 | 200–500 | Sponsor premiums; title belt |
| The Peak Championship | 20 | 3,000–5,000 | 1,000–2,000 | Highest single event prize in the realm |

*These figures are gross; fighters at Journeyman+ are advised to budget for agent fees (typically 10–15% of prize income) and equipment costs.*

---

## Tournament Structure

### Tournament Formats

| Format | Description | Best Used For | Seasonal Application |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Single Elimination** | Lose and you're out; maximum drama, efficient scheduling | Championship and title events; The Peak | Autumn championship season |
| **Round Robin** | All fighters face all others; purest skill ranking | Small group skill evaluation leagues; Novice circuits | Early season ranking events |
| **Swiss-Draw** | Matched by current standing; no eliminations until late rounds | Mid-season competitive ranking; larger participant pools | Mid-season City Arena events |
| **Multi-Stage Championship** | Regional qualifiers → semi-final pool → final bracket | Full season progression culminating at The Peak | Full year structure |
| **Invitational Exhibition** | Curated matchups between specific fighters; not ranking-eligible | Special events, festivals, cultural demonstrations | Flexible; patron-driven scheduling |

### Season Structure

The Pinnacle League tournament year follows a rhythm shaped by each arena's environmental constraints and its host city's cultural calendar.

**Annual tournament calendar (approximate):**

| Period | Months | Activity | Primary Arenas |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Pre-season** | 1–2 | Qualifier Open-Air events; fighter intake assessments; training camps | City Arena circuits |
| **Spring Season** | 3–5 | Regular season begins; Sunken Ring spring series (calm sea season) | The Sunken Ring |
| **Mid-Season** | 5–7 | Cross-arena events; Swiss-draw ranking tournaments; The Peak prep | All arenas |
| **Autumn Championship Season** | 8–10 | Blackwoods Autumn Circuit; Grand Kegfest Exhibition (joint with Thorin); City Arena finals |  Blackwoods, Wavebreaker, City circuits |
| **Championship Culmination** | 11 | The Peak Championship; Hall of Fame induction | The Peak |
| **Off-Season** | 12 | Training camps; mentorship programmes; exhibition charity events; fighter recovery | Underhelm (year-round) |

**Underhelm's year-round operation:**  
Because the underground environment is climate-stable, Underhelm operates a continuous lower-stakes circuit throughout the year. This makes it the primary development venue — fighters accumulate regular-season experience at Underhelm during months when other arenas are closed.

**Off-season programming:**
- Intensive cross-arena training camps (fighters travel to arenas they are not based in)
- **The Circuit** — a series of community exhibition matches in smaller towns and villages; Rini's outreach and talent-scouting programme; fighters earn modest event fees while building fan bases in new regions
- Fighter placement services (guard assignments, security contracts) are most active during off-season as fighters seek income between earning seasons

---

### Multi-Realm Event Logistics

Pinnacle League events that draw fighters and spectators from multiple kingdoms require significant logistics coordination — a key use case for RiniDimensionalTournamentBrackets.

**Fighter travel and portal booking:**
- The League holds a standing arrangement with licensed portal mages for fighter transport to The Peak (portal-only access); this is the single largest portal coordination contract among the hero businesses
- Grand Arena events: fighters arrange their own travel but the League provides route guidance, travel allowances at Veteran rank and above, and priority booking introductions through Bran Brightwood's caravan network
- Kingdom border crossing documentation is prepared by the League's administrative staff for all registered fighters travelling internationally

**Cross-kingdom permit requirements:**
- Each host kingdom requires an **Event Operating Permit** issued by their relevant authority (varies: Aurumvale requires Merchant Council approval; Underhelm requires Clan Council endorsement; Virellia requires Maritime and Events Commission sign-off)
- Rini handles permit applications for all Grand Arena events; City Arena partners manage their own permits for sanctioned events
- Wavebreaker's Siroccane location is technically in a nomadic kingdom that doesn't operate formal permits — Rini maintains a standing agreement with the Siroccane tribal council renewed seasonally

**Equipment transport for weapons and armour:**
- Fighters travelling with weaponry require a **Fighter's Transit Certificate** issued by the League; this document is recognised by all kingdoms where the League operates and expedites border crossing
- Custom or unusual weapons (oversized, enchanted, or multiplanar origin) require additional documentation; Delyra provides certification for enchanted equipment
- The League maintains shared equipment libraries at each arena for fighters who cannot transport their own gear; basic weapon sets available for loan at low cost

---

## Broadcasting and Media Culture

### Broadcast Rights Structure

Combat sports broadcasting via scrying crystal networks is the fastest-growing media sector in Nubimancy in AC 2247. The Pinnacle League is the dominant premium content provider.

**Ownership hierarchy:**
- Rini owns the rights to all Pinnacle League-branded content — this was a deliberate founding decision; no arena operates independently and no kingdom authority holds co-ownership of broadcast rights
- Arena-specific rights are licensed to regional scrying networks for local broadcast; multi-realm rights retained by the League for its own distribution
- Fighter image rights are split: fighters own their personal image; the League owns event footage; an agreed revenue share formula divides broadcast income between the League and participating fighters at Veteran rank and above

#### Audio vs. Visual Broadcast Tiers

Scrying broadcast exists in two distinct formats, reflecting both the scarcity of magic and the practical economics of the receiving end.

**Audio Relay (narrative / "radio"):**
The common form. A trained **broadcast scryer** at the arena maintains a voice-only relay to a network of receiving crystals across a region. The broadcast scryer narrates the bout in real time — calling strikes, crowd reaction, environmental hazards, fighter condition. Good commentators become famous in their own right and are contracted separately from the technical relay operators. A tavern-grade receiving crystal costs 20–40 AC and requires only a Tier 1 enchantment to maintain; affordable for any Common House-tier tavern or better.

The commentator is the product. Listeners in a tavern in Thalassor who have never seen The Sunken Ring form a complete mental picture from a skilled broadcast scryer. Audio rights are the mass-market product.

**Visual Scrying (multimedia / "early television"):**
A significantly more expensive format. The transmitting end requires a **visual scryer** with mid-tier magical ability maintaining a moving-image projection; the receiving end requires a large enchanted mirror or crystal panel with a Tier 3 enchantment actively maintained. The image quality is approximately "candlelight resolution" — clear enough to follow the action, not sharp enough to read expressions. Colour is present but muted.

Visual scrying receiving setups cost 300–600 AC to install and require ongoing enchantment maintenance (annual Tier 3 refresh from Delyra or a certified enchanter). This price point puts visual access firmly in two markets: **premium establishments** and **commercial gambling houses**.

**Why gambling houses are the primary visual rights customers:**
Audio-only broadcast creates a commercial trust problem for serious wagering. If patrons cannot see the fight themselves, they have no way to verify that the narration is not delayed, edited, or selectively shaped. A gambling house in Goldentarn or Bellharbor carrying Pinnacle League events needs visual feed as a commercial necessity — their wagering volume directly depends on patron confidence in the information they are betting on. Visual scrying is not a luxury for these venues; it is infrastructure.

Gambling house operators are consequently Rini's most commercially influential broadcast partners — and the relationship she is most personally ambivalent about. Their money is real and it funds fighter prize pools. Her mission is to channel violence constructively. She has a clear-eyed policy: the League will work with licensed, regulated gambling establishments in kingdoms where wagering is legal; it will not provide any broadcast access to unlicensed venues or kingdoms where gambling is prohibited. The line is enforced.

**Broadcast access by venue type:**

| Venue Type | Broadcast Format | Typical Cost to Venue | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Common tavern | Audio only | 20–40 AC receiving crystal + 3–6 AC/year maintenance | Most taverns at Common House tier and above carry audio; receiving crystal a one-time purchase |
| Respectable/Renowned tavern | Audio; some upgrade to visual | 300–600 AC installation for visual | Visual upgrade confers status; popular with Renowned-tier taverns seeking differentiation |
| Licensed gambling house | Visual (required) | 300–600 AC installation + premium rights fee | Cannot operate competitive wagering effectively without visual; willing to pay |
| Noble household / patron club | Visual | Private installation; often gifted or patron-subsidised | Social viewing events; The Peak Championship is a highlight of the season calendar |
| Public square (city-funded) | Audio relay only | City pays relay access fee; no viewing infrastructure | Cities sponsor public audio during major events for civic atmosphere; popular before The Peak |
| Aetheros Academy | Visual (special arrangement) | Aethernet Relay provides signal; Academy provides hardware | Academic and prestige context; smallest audience, highest per-viewer cultural cachet |

**Scrying network coverage deals** (maps to `33-scrying-service-providers.csv`):

| Network | Format | Coverage Area | Rights Tier | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **Virellian Maritime Scry Network** | Audio + Visual | Virellia, coastal kingdoms | Premium | Longest-standing partner; Sunken Ring primary broadcaster; serves the densest gambling house market |
| **Underhelm Crystal Relay** | Audio only | Underhelm, Durnholde, underground communities | Standard | Deep-distribution specialist; visual scrying technically impractical underground (mirror alignment issues) |
| **Cindralis Industrial Broadcast** | Audio + Visual (major cities) | Ashford, Cindralis Sovereignty | Standard | Blackwoods home network; visual only in Ashford betting guilds |
| **Aethernet Relay (Aetheros)** | Visual (special) | Nimbuspire, floating city radius | Premium+ | Small audience; highest per-viewer income; Magocracy-facilitated; The Peak Championship special broadcast |
| **Aurumvale Commercial Scry** | Audio + Visual | Aurumvale Republic | Premium | Highest advertising revenue; most developed gambling house market; commercial sponsor integration |
| **Independent travelling scryers** | Audio only | Event-by-event | Ad-hoc | Rini accredits travelling broadcast scryers for regional and festival coverage |

**The Peak Championship** commands a special multi-network broadcast arrangement — all partner networks carry it simultaneously, with the Aethernet Relay pushing visual to a broader receiving base than any other event. It is the only event where the League negotiates a flat rights fee rather than revenue share, reflecting unprecedented demand. Visual gambling house access for The Peak commands the highest per-event rights premium of any League content.

**Regional vs. multi-realm licensing:**
- Audio regional license (single kingdom): 80–200 AC per event season
- Visual regional license (single kingdom): 200–500 AC per event season (gambling house uplift negotiated separately)
- Multi-realm bundle (all five arenas, audio + visual): Negotiated annually; current total broadcast income is the League's second-largest revenue stream after live event ticket sales

### Audience and Spectatorship

**Live attendance expectations by arena:**

| Arena | Typical Event Attendance | Cultural Experience | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------|----|
| The Sunken Ring | 3,000–8,000 | Festive, cosmopolitan; street food and merchants outside; diplomatic social scene | Highest international attendee diversity |
| Underhelm | 800–2,500 | Intimate, reverent; quieter between bouts; audience calls out hold affiliations | Lowest capacity, but most loyal; repeat attendance rate highest of any arena |
| Blackwoods | 2,000–5,000 | Industrial, intense; very vocal audience; heat means shorter spectator dwell time | Vendor economy for cooling drinks notable |
| Wavebreaker | 400–1,200 | Sparse but deeply engaged; storytelling between bouts is traditional | Audience often includes non-Siroccane travellers who heard about the arena |
| The Peak | 150–300 (capacity limited) | Elite, ceremonial; patrons stand at perimeter; no vendors; pure sport focus | Invitation or qualification required; most expensive event per attendee |

**Remote viewing via scrying crystal:**
- Scrying crystal sets capable of receiving broadcast signals are owned by approximately 5–8% of households in major cities — the same affluent bracket that buys Tier 2+ enchantments from Delyra
- Public scrying viewings (taverns and public halls that carry broadcast events) dramatically expand effective audience; a popular Sunken Ring bout may reach 50,000+ viewers across the Virellian kingdom
- The Aethernet Relay makes The Peak accessible to the Nimbuspire academic community; a particularly prestigious dimension of championship coverage

**Gambling and wagering:**

| Kingdom | Legal Status | Typical Wagering Volume | Notes |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Virellia | Fully legal and regulated | Highest; odds publicly posted | Betting houses near The Sunken Ring are major businesses |
| Aurumvale | Legal with licensing | High; commercially organised | Merchant class treats fight betting as a commercial activity |
| Cindralis | Permitted; informal control | Moderate; guild-internal wagering dominant | No formal public houses; guild networks self-regulate |
| Underhelm | Traditional honour-bets only; no commercial gambling permitted | Low commercial volume | Dwarven clan honour-bets predate currency; League has no involvement in these |
| Siroccane | Honour-bet tradition; no commercial gambling | Minimal commercial volume | As with Underhelm, tribal tradition rather than commercial activity |
| Aetheros | Technically prohibited (considered undignified) | Low; private among wealthy citizens | Rini does not engage with Aetheros gambling regardless |

**Sponsorship and commercial advertising:**
- Per-event fighter kit sponsorship (name/sigil visible on fighter's armour) is the entry-level sponsorship product; priced at 15–80 AC per event depending on fighter rank
- Arena naming rights and event title sponsorship are the flagship products; current title sponsors include one Aurumvale merchant house (The Sunken Ring's spring series) and the Underhelm Mining Authority (Underhelm winter circuit)
- Broadcast integration (sponsor mentions during scrying commentary) included in premium broadcast packages; Rini retains final approval on all sponsor mentions with League content

### Loyalty Programs and Season Ticketing

**Season ticket structure** (maps to `61-loyalty-programs.csv`):

| Tier | Name | Price (AC/season) | Included | Notes |
|------|------|------------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Fan** | 12–20 (varies by arena) | General admission for all regular season events at home arena | Most accessible; single-arena |
| 2 | **Supporter** | 35–50 | General admission + priority queue + one fighter meet opportunity | Per-arena or multi-arena option for Veteran+ fans |
| 3 | **Patron** | 100–150 | Reserved seating + pre-event briefing + fighter access | Commercial patron tier; includes brand acknowledgement at events |
| 4 | **Champion Patron** | 350–500 | VIP access across all arenas + The Peak qualifier events + fighter sponsorship naming right | For serious commercial sponsors and high-wealth individuals |
| 5 | **League Patron** | By negotiation (typically 1,000+) | Full The Peak access + fighter development sponsorship + co-branding across the season | Rini-direct relationship; institutional and noble patron level |

**Fan culture differences by kingdom:**
- **Virellian fans:** Social and celebrity-focused; fighter personalities and storylines matter as much as results; fan groups attach to specific fighters and follow them across arenas; the fan-fighter relationship is performative and public
- **Dwarven fans (Underhelm):** Hold-loyalty first; audience cheers for fighters from their home hold; the communal clan identity is the anchor; less interested in fighter celebrity, more in hold representation
- **Cindralis fans:** Results-focused meritocrats; respect for anyone who succeeds; rapid switching of favourite fighter if a previous one underperforms; hard to build long-term fan loyalty but very loud when they are invested  
- **Siroccane fans:** Story-first; they come for the narrative of the fighter as much as the bout; oral storytelling tradition means word-of-mouth audience growth is unusually strong relative to population size
