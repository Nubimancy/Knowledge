## Overview

This document defines the cultural, technical, and commercial dimensions of ale production and consumption across Nubimancy's kingdoms. Thorin Caskmantle's businesses (ThorinDwarvenAleQualityTracking, ThorinTavernNetworkRelationshipManagement, ThorinCommunityEventOrchestration) depend on this as their primary domain narrative.

Ale is not merely a beverage in Nubimancy — it is a social institution. Dwarven brewing traditions, stretching back over a thousand years, codified the craft into something between an art form, an engineering discipline, and a clerical practice. When Thorin Caskmantle left adventuring to found Port & Pour, he carried both the old traditions and a distribution vision the mountains had never seen.

## Ale Categories and Styles

### Dwarven Traditional Ales

The backbone of Port & Pour's catalogue. These styles originate from specific mountain holds and are jealously protected by their founding clans — though Thorin has negotiated distribution rights for most major styles.

| Ale Name | Style | Origin Hold | Flavor Profile | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Stonefire Stout** | Dark stout | Ironhold Deep | Roasted cave fungi, ash-smoke finish, thick body | Port & Pour flagship; highest volume seller |
| **Deep Crystal Lager** | Pale lager | Crystalhall | Clean mineral water notes, light bitterness, crystal clarity | Brewed using glacial springs; requires cold storage throughout distribution |
| **Ember Amber** | Amber ale | Caskmantle Hold | Caramel malt, smooth mid-body, copper hue | Thorin's family recipe; most accessible to non-dwarven palates |
| **Ironvein Dark** | Porter | Grimgate Hold | Iron-mineral tang, dark roast, dense body | Acquired taste; popular with miners and soldiers |
| **Bedrock Bitter** | English-style bitter | Several holds (blended) | High bitterness, light body, clean finish | Session ale; tavern staple for daily consumption |

**Dwarven brewing traditions by hold:**
- **Ironhold Deep:** Slow-roast methods using enchanted kilns; obsessive quality control; only produce Stonefire Stout and one seasonal variant annually
- **Crystalhall:** Precision mineral-water blending; each batch tested against a crystal clarity standard; no magical shortcuts permitted in the traditional process
- **Caskmantle Hold:** Family-recipe focus; Thorin's personal connection; moderate volume, high consistency
- **Grimgate Hold:** Volume-first philosophy; produces more barrels than any other hold, but quality is inconsistent without Thorin's oversight
- **Multiple holds (contract):** Supply grain and hops to Thorin's own blending operations for the Bedrock Bitter line

**Core ingredients from underground sources:**
- **Cave Barley** — grows in bioluminescent cavern farms; gives dwarven ales their distinctive earthiness
- **Mineral Spring Water** — drawn from deep aquifers; different holds use different sources, creating terroir variations
- **Cave Fungi (Deepmalt)** — dried and roasted; provides the characteristic roasted-earth flavor in dark styles; classified as a rare ingredient for magical preservation
- **Ironroot Hops** — cultivated along underground stream walls; bitter and aromatic; no surface equivalent

### Seasonal and Lunar Ales

These limited-run styles follow the Aetherian Calendar seasonal cycle and the dual-moon system. They command premium prices and are often the deciding factor in tavern partnership agreements — exclusive access to popular limited releases is a key loyalty tool.

| Ale Name | Season / Trigger | Availability Window | Premium Over Base Price |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Spring Thaw Wheat** | Spring (months 2-4) | ~90 days | +30–50% |
| **Harvest Gold Ale** | Autumn (months 8-10) | ~90 days | +40–60% |
| **Winter Solstice Reserve** | Winter (month 12 + month 1) | ~60 days | +80–120% |
| **Moonveil Pale** | Full Silvara moon | 3–4 days per 28-day cycle | +60–80% |
| **Coprus Flame** | Full Coprus moon | 2–3 days per 20-day cycle | +70–90% |
| **Conjunction Dark** | The Conjunction (~every 140 days) | 1–2 days only | +200–350% |

**Lunar brewing notes:**
- **Silvara-aligned ales** (Moonveil Pale, Winter Solstice Reserve) — fermentation is started during the full Silvara phase; brewers report more consistent flavor development and a naturally occurring shimmer in the liquid
- **Coprus-aligned ales** (Coprus Flame) — fermentation uses heat-accelerated methods during Coprus full; produces intense, fiery flavor profiles and higher potency
- **Conjunction Dark** — Thorin's rarest product; brewed exclusively during the Conjunction (both moons dark); extremely limited production; black in color with unusual depth of flavor; sought by collectors and legendary taverns; each barrel is individually numbered and documented

**Limited edition release calendar practices:**
- Seasonal ales are announced 4–6 weeks ahead; tavern partners receive allocation notices before open market
- Lunar ales are produced in small batches; allocated to Tier 3+ (Renowned) partner taverns first
- Conjunction Dark is fully allocated to Legendary partner taverns and direct patron orders before any batch is brewed

### Cross-Kingdom Ale Varieties

Port & Pour distributes select non-dwarven ales as part of a premium variety programme, sourced through Thorin's supplier relationships and Bran's caravan network for remote origins.

| Ale Name | Style | Origin | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Silverleaf Saison** | Elven saison | Virellia / Aetheros | Light, floral, long secondary fermentation; extremely delicate preservation requirements |
| **Tidebreaker Wheat** | Human coastal wheat ale | Thalassor / Bellharbor area | Salt-mineral edge; popular along sea routes |
| **Cindralis Red** | Industrial amber | Cindralis | Sharp, metallic-edge finish; popular with craftworkers |
| **Planar Amber** (exotic) | Planar-brewed amber | Dimensional sourcing via Bran | Unusual color shifts with temperature; rare ingredient content; available only to Legendary partners |

**Cross-kingdom sourcing notes:**
- Elven ales require specialist cold-chain preservation (Tier 3 enchantment minimum) due to their delicate fermentation cultures — more expensive to distribute than dwarven ales
- Planar Amber arrives through Bran Brightwood's caravan network at irregular intervals; Port & Pour takes small allocation when available; treated as ultra-premium / collector category
- Human regional ales are easier to source but more competitive on price; Port & Pour carries select varieties as a "local flavor" offering in each city's assortment

## Quality Standards

### Dwarven Quality Classification System

Port & Pour uses the four-tier Ironhold Classification system, recognized across all major kingdoms as the ale industry standard. Guild-certified inspectors issue classification certificates.

| Grade | Name | Criteria | Guild Cert Required | Typical Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Iron** | Iron Grade | Meets minimum food-safe threshold; consistent color and clarity; no contamination | No | Mass distribution, lower-tier taverns |
| **Bronze** | Bronze Grade | Documented recipe compliance; purity score 60%+; delivery acceptance rate 90%+ | Journeyman inspector | Standard tavern stock |
| **Silver** | Silver Grade | Purity score 80%+; blind taste panel approved; enhanced preservation applied | Master inspector | Respectable to Renowned taverns |
| **Gold** | Gold Grade | Purity score 95%+; single-origin batch; master brewer signed; lunar timing documented | Guild Master inspector | Renowned and Legendary taverns; collectors |

**Taste profile scoring dimensions:**

Each ale is rated on five dimensions, scored 1–10, producing a **Taste Profile Score (TPS)** out of 50:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Bitterness** | Hop presence; balance against malt sweetness |
| **Body** | Weight and texture on the palate |
| **Clarity** | Visual and flavor cleanliness; absence of off-flavors |
| **Aroma** | Complexity and pleasantness of nose |
| **Potency** | Alcohol presence and warmth |

**Purity score** is a separate chemical/alchemical assessment measuring contamination absence, ingredient authenticity, and process compliance. Purity score is required to unlock Silver and Gold grade certification.

**Acceptable variance thresholds for delivery acceptance:**
- Iron Grade: TPS within ±15% of target profile
- Bronze Grade: TPS within ±10%; purity within ±8%
- Silver Grade: TPS within ±6%; purity within ±4%
- Gold Grade: TPS within ±3%; purity within ±2%; any failure triggers full batch rejection

### Quality Checkpoints

Port & Pour operates a four-stage checkpoint system, documented in BC against each production and delivery order:

| Checkpoint | Stage | Who Performs | Key Tests |
|-----------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **QC-1: Pre-Brew** | Ingredient receipt | Caskwarden or approved inspector | Ingredient authenticity, freshness, water mineral profile |
| **QC-2: Mid-Brew** | Fermentation midpoint | Master brewer | Gravity reading, color check, contamination screen |
| **QC-3: Post-Brew** | Pre-barrel | Guild inspector (Silver/Gold) or Caskwarden (Iron/Bronze) | Full TPS + purity score; enchantment compatibility assessment |
| **QC-4: Delivery** | On arrival at tavern | Alebound Courier or Caskwarden | Seal integrity, temperature compliance, visual check; Caskwarden signs delivery receipt |

---

### Preservation Requirements

Ale quality is highly time- and temperature-sensitive. Preservation enchantments (sourced from Delyra and licensed enchanters) are critical to Port & Pour's distribution model.

| Ale Category | Natural Shelf Life (Unenchanted) | Enchanted Shelf Life | Required Enchantment Tier | Serving Temperature |
|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Dwarven Dark (stout, porter) | 60 days | 180 days | Tier 1 Preservation | 14–16°C (cellar cool) |
| Dwarven Pale (lager, bitter) | 45 days | 150 days | Tier 1 Preservation | 8–10°C (cold) |
| Seasonal Ales | 30–45 days | 120 days | Tier 2 Preservation | Varies by style |
| Elven Light Ales | 14 days | 90 days | Tier 3 Preservation (required) | 6–8°C (very cold) |
| Conjunction Dark | 21 days | 365 days | Tier 3 Preservation (required) | 16–18°C (room cool) |

**Degradation factors during transport:**
- **Portal transit** — negligible degradation; preferred for high-value and delicate ales
- **Sea transport** — vibration causes minor flavor disruption in lagers and light ales; recommend 2-week settling period on arrival
- **Overland wagon** — road vibration is the highest-risk transport mode for clarity and carbonation; enchanted barrel suspension reduces impact
- **Temperature exposure** — each hour above the optimal range reduces enchanted shelf life by approximately 1 day; documented in QC-4

## Brewing Industry Structure

### Brewery Types and Tiers

| Type | Scale | Distribution Model | Guild Relationship |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Master Hold** | Large-scale; 50,000+ barrels/year | Wide kingdom distribution; Thorin-contracted | Full Brewers' Guild membership; annual certification |
| **Clan Brewery** | Medium-scale; 5,000–50,000 barrels/year | Regional focus; ale varieties tied to local traditions | Clan charter with Guild endorsement |
| **Artisan Ale House** | Small-batch; under 5,000 barrels/year | Local and select premium distribution | Licensed producer; no certification required below 1,000 barrels |
| **Contract Brewery** | Variable; produces under a distributor's specification | Port & Pour contract; label may not disclose origin | Operates under distributor's Guild certification |

Port & Pour works primarily with Master Hold and Clan Brewery sources for volume, and selectively with Artisan Ale Houses for premium and limited-edition lines.

---

### Sourcing and Supply Chain

**Key supplier regions:**
- **Underhelm and surrounding mountains** — Primary source for dwarven-style grains, Cave Barley, Deepmalt fungi, and Ironroot Hops
- **Durnholde foothills** — Secondary grain source; surface barley and wheat for lighter styles and human-style ales
- **Aetheros and Virellia** — Specialty hops and botanicals for elven ales and exotic varieties
- **Thalassor coast** — Sea minerals used in coastal-style ales; salt and kelp extracts for Tidebreaker Wheat

**Rare ingredient acquisition:**
- Deepmalt fungi — harvested by licensed cave farmers; supply constrained; price spikes before Conjunction brews
- Moonpetal hops (for Moonveil Pale) — surface-grown but highly lunar-cycle dependent; harvested during Silvara gibbous phase only; short window per cycle
- Planar brewing materials — opportunistic sourcing via Bran Brightwood's caravan routes; no guaranteed supply; treated as exceptional inventory

### Pricing and Economics

**Standard barrel pricing by grade (Aurumvale Crowns):**

| Grade | Price Range per Barrel | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Iron | 8–12 AC | Base distribution product |
| Bronze | 15–22 AC | Volume backbone of tavern contracts |
| Silver | 28–40 AC | Premium tavern stock |
| Gold | 60–120 AC | Limited; allocated not listed |

**Seasonal price adjustments:**
- Seasonal ales carry +30–120% premium over equivalent-grade standard ale (see seasonal table above)
- Ingredient cost spikes (Cave Barley can increase 20–40% before Conjunction season) are partially absorbed as brand investment
- Cross-kingdom ales carry a +15–25% sourcing premium on top of standard grade pricing

**Limited edition pricing norms:**
- Conjunction Dark is sold by the named barrel only; price range 200–500 AC per barrel depending on vintage and demand
- All limited edition pre-allocations are sold at confirmed-price; no open-market price speculation permitted under Port & Pour partner agreements

## Tavern Culture and Commerce

### Tavern Tiers and Classification

Port & Pour classifies partner taverns into five tiers that determine ale allocation, exclusive access rights, and service levels. Tier is assessed annually by Caskwardens.

| Tier | Name | Criteria | Ale Access | Thorin's Volume Share |
|------|------|----------|------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Roadside** | Basic establishment; passes food safety inspection; no volume commitment | Iron and Bronze grades only | ~15% of total tavern volume |
| 2 | **Common House** | Stable trade; 20+ barrel/month commitment; Caskwarden visit accepted | Iron, Bronze, select Bronze-grade seasonal | ~35% of total tavern volume |
| 3 | **Respectable** | Consistent volume (50+ barrels/month); quality compliance record; visible Port & Pour signage | Bronze, Silver, seasonal ales | ~30% of total tavern volume |
| 4 | **Renowned** | 100+ barrels/month; Silver-grade minimum stock; event hosting capability; dedicated tap line | Bronze, Silver, Gold, lunar editions | ~15% of total tavern volume |
| 5 | **Legendary** | Flagship partnership; 200+ barrels/month; Gold-grade commitment; exclusivity agreements honored | Full catalogue including Conjunction Dark | ~5% of total tavern volume |

**Cultural expectations by region:**
- **Dwarven kingdoms (Underhelm, Durnholde):** Taverns are considered community halls; ale quality is a matter of civic pride; Renowned-tier is the minimum expected by serious establishments
- **Human port cities (Thalassor, Virellia):** Commercial pragmatism; volume and price matter most; Bronze-grade dominates
- **Aetheros:** High standards; magical enhancements to tavern ambiance are common; Silver-grade minimum expected by serious patrons
- **Frontier and remote kingdoms (Fenroth, Bramblewyn):** Any ale is welcomed; Iron-grade well-received; occasional special shipments build outsized loyalty

**Licensing requirements:**
- All taverns must hold a valid Trade License in their kingdom (verified at Tier 1 onboarding)
- Renowned and Legendary tier requires Brewers' Guild associate membership (endorsement from Thorin's Caskwarden team covers this)

| Renowned | Priority | Lunar edition access; 20% seasonal pre-allocation; event support | 100 barrels/month | Net-30 |
| Legendary | First | Conjunction Dark; full brand partnership; joint event planning; dedicated Caskwarden contact | 200 barrels/month | Net-45, volume discount |

---

### Delivery and Restocking Customs

**Accepted delivery windows (cultural norms):**
- Deliveries are expected before the morning service period (before the midday meal); arriving during evening trade is considered disruptive in most kingdoms
- Underhelm and dwarven holds: deliveries accepted any time during the low-traffic morning or mid-afternoon window; rigorous receipt inspection expected
- Coastal ports (Thalassor, Virellia, Bellharbor): shipments often arrive with cargo vessels; tavern owners coordinate with the port Caskwarden office on arrival timing

**Tap room arrangement:**
- Port & Pour barrels are marked with the Port & Pour sealmark and grade symbol; taverns are contractually required to display brand signage at Respectable tier and above
- Routing of tap lines is the tavern owner's responsibility; Port & Pour provides setup guidance at Renowned tier and above
- Mixed tap rooms (multiple distributors) are permitted at all tiers; exclusivity clauses only apply to Legendary tier

**Return and rejection policies for quality failures:**
- QC-4 delivery failures: Courier documents failure, logs dispute reference number in BC, returns barrel to nearest Hub
- Tavern-initiated quality complaints accepted within 7 days of delivery
- Credit is issued against next delivery order; no cash refunds except for Legendary tier partners
- Repeated QC-4 failures from the same brewery source trigger a sourcing review by the Caskwarden team

## Community Events and Festivals

### Major Ale Festivals

| Event | Timing | Location | Type | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **The Grand Kegfest** | Week of the autumn full Silvara | Underhelm, The Deepmarket Square | Annual dwarven cultural | Largest ale event in the realm; Port & Pour is title sponsor; 400+ barrels consumed over 5 days |
| **Harvest Tide Festival** | Month 9 (harvest season) | Rotates between Aurumvale, Thalassor | Human harvest celebration | Extended ale focus; seasonal ales launch here; multi-city simultaneous events |
| **The Moonveil Gathering** | Full Silvara nearest to summer solstice | Aetheros, The Floating Court | Mixed-culture prestige event | Elven hosts; Port & Pour provides the ale programme; limited attendance |
| **Conjunction Night** | The Conjunction (every ~140 days) | Varies; community-organized | Spiritual observance | Businesses often closed; private consumption; Conjunction Dark is gifted, not sold, at community events |
| **The Wandering Keg** | Rolling; 8–10 events per year | City-by-city circuit | Traveling festival | Thorin's community outreach programme; arrives in a city for 3 days; features regional ale spotlights and Port & Pour brand events |

**The Wandering Keg festival circuit** is the primary mechanism for ThorinCommunityEventOrchestration. Managing the circuit involves:
- Venue scouting and booking (typically 3+ months advance)
- Ale allocation from the nearest regional Hub
- Artisan and food vendor coordination
- Caskwarden staffing and security contracts
- Local partnership tier upgrades following successful events

---

### Event Planning Norms

**Venue selection criteria for ale events:**
- Adequate cellar or cool-storage space for the allocated ale stock (minimum 48 hours pre-chilling)
- Public accessibility (Thorin's events are positioned as community, not exclusive)
- Space for ale service lines, vendor stalls, and safe crowd circulation
- Kingdom event permit compatibility — some kingdoms require Brewers' Guild co-sponsorship for public events over a certain size

**Staffing and security:**
- Caskwardens serve as event lead and quality control oversight
- Alebound Couriers handle setup logistics and barrel transport
- Security contracted locally; Thorin requires minimum baseline standards (no private combat permitted at Guild event venues)

**Vendor and artisan invitation protocols:**
- Food vendors are invited to complement the ale programme, not compete with it
- Artisan brewers may showcase at The Wandering Keg if their ale meets Bronze-grade minimum and they are willing to distribute through Port & Pour or a Thorin-approved partner channel
- Vendor invitations issued by the Caskwarden for the hosting region; confirmed in ThorinCommunityEventOrchestration's event management module
