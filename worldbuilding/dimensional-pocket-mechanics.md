# Dimensional Pocket Mechanics

**Status:** 🔴 Placeholder — Required for Delyra hero company demo data
**Priority:** CRITICAL — Pocket dimensions are the core infrastructure for Delyra's multiplanar work centers and portal shop operations; also referenced in nubimancy-system.md at a high level

## Overview

This document details the mechanics, stability requirements, and commercial applications of dimensional pockets (also called pocket dimensions or extradimensional spaces) in Nubimancy. While `nubimancy-system.md` introduces pocket dimensions as a technology platform concept, this document goes deeper into the operational and narrative rules governing their existence, maintenance, and business use. Delyra Voss's multiplanar work centers operate within pocket dimensions, and her portal shops may use dimensional adjacency for unique retail positioning.

## What Is a Pocket Dimension?

### Nature and Properties
- **[To be completed]** — How pocket dimensions exist relative to the material plane
- **[To be completed]** — Size limits (maximum stable volume achievable)
- **[To be completed]** — Interior vs. exterior time flow differences (basis for the time acceleration ratio in work centers)
- **[To be completed]** — Physical law variations (gravity, temperature, light — how they differ from the material plane)

### Types of Pocket Dimensions
- **[To be completed]** — Natural Pockets (rare, discovered rather than created, highly prized)
- **[To be completed]** — Crafted Pockets (mage-constructed, most common commercial type)
- **[To be completed]** — Inherited Pockets (passed between owners, may carry enchantment residue)
- **[To be completed]** — Leased/Shared Pockets (multi-tenant dimensional spaces, complex governance)

## Creation and Anchoring

### Who Can Create Pocket Dimensions
- **[To be completed]** — Required magical tier and specialization (Dimensional Mage certification)
- **[To be completed]** — Creation cost (materials, mage time, one-time vs. ongoing)
- **[To be completed]** — Legal requirements (permits, kingdom registry, guild oversight)

### Anchor Points
- **[To be completed]** — What an anchor point is (the material-plane entry portal)
- **[To be completed]** — How many anchor points a pocket dimension can have
- **[To be completed]** — What happens if an anchor point is destroyed
- **[To be completed]** — Movable vs. fixed anchor points

## Stability and Maintenance

### Stability Factors
- **[To be completed]** — Base stability duration without maintenance
- **[To be completed]** — Factors that accelerate instability (overuse, magical interference, ley line proximity)
- **[To be completed]** — Stability warning signs (visual, physical, aethernet sensor readings)

### Maintenance Requirements
- **[To be completed]** — Safety check interval norms (maps to `53-dimensional-work-centers.csv` field)
- **[To be completed]** — Who performs stability maintenance (Dimensional Mage required, or can enchanters assist)
- **[To be completed]** — Emergency stabilization protocols

### Collapse Scenarios
- **[To be completed]** — What happens to contents when a pocket dimension collapses
- **[To be completed]** — Recovery procedures after partial collapse
- **[To be completed]** — Insurance and liability norms in the commercial market

## Commercial Applications

### Multiplanar Work Centers (Delyra)
- **[To be completed]** — Why time acceleration makes dimensional work centers valuable for enchantment production
- **[To be completed]** — Standard time acceleration ratios available commercially
- **[To be completed]** — Staff limits and safety requirements inside dimensional work centers
- **[To be completed]** — What types of work benefit most from dimensional acceleration

### Portal Shop Positioning (Delyra)
- **[To be completed]** — What makes a dimensionally-adjacent shop commercially attractive
- **[To be completed]** — Inventory dynamics — does stock inside a pocket dimension age differently?
- **[To be completed]** — Customer experience of entering a portal shop

### Storage and Logistics Applications
- **[To be completed]** — Use of pocket dimensions as warehousing (who uses this, typical capacity)
- **[To be completed]** — Preservation advantages of dimensional storage for perishable goods
- **[To be completed]** — BC warehouse zone implications (maps to `21-warehouse-zones-by-location.csv`)

### Creature Habitats (Weltina adjacency)
- **[To be completed]** — Whether pocket dimensions are used for specialized creature habitats
- **[To be completed]** — Stability requirements for biological occupants
- **[To be completed]** — Regulatory status of dimensional creature habitats

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

### Ownership Rights
- **[To be completed]** — Who legally owns a pocket dimension (creator, kingdom, registered owner)
- **[To be completed]** — Transfer and inheritance of pocket dimension ownership
- **[To be completed]** — Disputes and legal mechanisms

### Kingdom Regulations
- **[To be completed]** — Which kingdoms permit commercial pocket dimension use
- **[To be completed]** — Restricted use cases (weapons manufacturing, illegal goods, dimensional hoarding)
- **[To be completed]** — Tax treatment of dimensional commerce
