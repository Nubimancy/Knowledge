# Dimensional Pocket Mechanics

**Status:** 🟡 Framework — Core rules established; fine detail for specific habitats and legacy artifacts can expand later
**Priority:** CRITICAL — Foundation for Delyra's multiplanar work centers and Weltina's creature habitat program

## Overview

A pocket dimension is not a room someone built — it is a fold in the fabric of the planes that a mage learned to hold open and inhabit. The ability to create a stable pocket dimension is among the rarest accomplishments in recorded magical history. Across all of Nubimancy's known world, perhaps three to six individuals in any given generation possess the combination of raw power, dimensional affinity, and learned technique required. They have always worked alone, for personal purposes, and their pockets have almost always died with them.

Delyra Voss is one of these individuals. In AC 2247, she is likely one of two or three living practitioners. Her workshop, which she calls **the Fold**, is her greatest personal achievement and the quiet engine behind Art of Facts' production capacity. It is not a product she sells. It is where she works.

## What Is a Pocket Dimension?

### Physical Nature

A pocket dimension exists at a crease point between the material plane and the planes adjacent to it — most commonly the elemental planes (fire, water, ice, storm, shadow, verdance) and the liminal spaces between them. It is not a slice of the void; it borrows structural existence from its neighbours. When a mage shapes a pocket, they are choosing a location in the planar topology, folding the material plane boundary inward, and sealing that fold into a stable interior space.

The interior can range from a single room to a complex of halls, depending on the mage's power and the energy available at the anchor point. The largest known historical pockets were roughly the size of a small manor house. Delyra's Fold is approximately the size of a well-appointed craftsperson's workshop — large enough for a team of six to work comfortably, with material storage and a separate anteroom.

### Interior Properties

The properties of a pocket's interior depend on what was available during shaping. A mage can tune:

| Property | Range | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Time flow** | 1:1 to roughly 10:1 (material : interior) | Higher ratios require more powerful seals and more frequent maintenance |
| **Temperature** | As cold as deep ice plane to as warm as fire plane boundary | Elemental habitats require deliberate tuning toward a specific plane |
| **Gravity** | Standard material-plane gravity is default; deviation is difficult and unstable | |
| **Light** | Can be steady interior light independent of any source; common in workshops | |
| **Adjacent plane influence** | Determined by which planes are "near" the anchor point | Cannot be fully eliminated — only managed |

Delyra's Fold runs at a 7:1 time acceleration ratio. Seven hours pass inside for every one hour outside, which means a day of work inside the Fold accomplishes roughly a week's worth of client output. This ratio is lower than the Nubimancy Ledger Realm's reported 10:1 ratio, which reflects the resources available to Aetheros as an organization versus a single practitioner crafting independently. A 7:1 ratio is extraordinary for a solo-maintained dimensional space.

### What a Pocket Is Not

- A pocket dimension is **not a portal gate**. Portal gates are fixed doorways between material-plane locations, connecting real cities through a stable planar aperture. Delyra's five shops are connected to each other by portal gates — they are real buildings in real places, linked by traversable apertures. The Fold is the only pocket dimension she maintains. See [Portal Gates vs. Pocket Dimensions](#portal-gates-vs-pocket-dimensions) below.
- A pocket dimension is **not a permanent structure** in the way a building is. It requires ongoing maintenance by its creator. If that maintenance stops, the pocket eventually collapses.

## Historical Rarity

### The Three-to-Six Rule

In any generation of magical practitioners, historical records and guild lore suggest three to six individuals ever achieved the capacity to craft a stable pocket dimension. The actual number is likely lower — many reports are exaggerated or confused with other forms of planar magic. What is well-attested is that pocket dimension crafters have always been rare enough to be individually famous within magical scholarship. Their names survive in guild annals for centuries after their deaths.

Their pockets have not.

### Personal Use and Loss

Historically, mage-crafted pockets were used exclusively for:

- **Personal research**: experimentation with dangerous or unpredictable magic that a mage did not want to conduct on the material plane
- **Secure shelter**: a private space inaccessible to enemies, unreachable without the mage's own anchor; some historical mages essentially lived in their pockets
- **Preservation vaults**: storing materials, artifacts, or knowledge that required controlled conditions
- **Private experimentation** with the planes themselves — testing proximity to elemental or liminal energies in a survivable container

These were not businesses. The pockets were sealed to the mage's personal magical signature — no apprentice could maintain them, no guild could take custody. When the mage died, the seals began failing. Depending on the mage's remaining strength at death, collapse could take days, weeks, or (rarely) months. Contents were typically evacuated by the mage's successors as quickly as possible once decline began.

### Artifact-Anchored Survivors

A handful of pockets throughout history were bound to a material object — an artifact of sufficient magical resonance to serve as a permanent anchor, divorcing the pocket's existence from the mage's life force. These **Legacy Pockets** are among the most significant magical artifacts in the world. Only a dozen or so are believed to survive in AC 2247.

Legacy pockets are treated as territorial treasures. Kingdoms have gone to war over them. Most are held by crown collections, powerful guild vaults, or ancient noble houses. Some are kept secret. Their locations are not publicly registered.

The **Nubimancy Ledger Realm** is a notable modern example: a crafted pocket built into the platform's infrastructure by the mages of Aetheros and anchored to the Nubimancy Engine apparatus itself. It is among the most stable pocket dimensions in existence, maintained by an organization rather than a single practitioner and backed by Aetheros's collective magical resources. Its 10:1 time ratio reflects this organizational scale.

## Creating a Pocket Dimension

### Who Can Do This

There is no formal certification pathway because there has never been enough practitioners to build one. The Aetheric Mages' Compact — the loose international body that governs magical ethics among the highest-tier practitioners — recognizes dimensional crafting as an elite discipline and maintains informal ethical guidance around it, but there is no exam, no registry, no bureau of oversight.

A practitioner who can craft a pocket dimension exhibits three traits that no amount of training can reliably produce:

1. **Top-tier core magical capacity** — required simply to sustain the energy needed during shaping
2. **Dimensional affinity** — an instinctive, not fully teachable sensitivity to planar topology that allows the mage to read the crease points between planes and understand how to hold them
3. **Seal-locking technique** — the specific learned discipline of encoding a dimensional space to respond to the crafter's signature and reject external interference

Delyra Voss developed all three. She is in her late twenties. Among the Aetheric Mages' Compact, this is considered remarkable bordering on unsettling.

### The Shaping Process

Creating a pocket dimension is a multi-week undertaking requiring:

- **Anchor site selection**: Identifying a material-plane location where the planar topology is suitable — a place where the boundary between the material plane and desired adjacent planes is thin but stable
- **Materials**: Boundary Silk (sourced from dimensional boundary zones), Void Crystal flakes, Resonance Dust, and planar-specific materials depending on the interior tuning desired (Dream Crystal shards for stable vision-true light; Thornmere Salt for temperature management)
- **Shaping and sealing**: The mage works at the anchor site for one to three weeks, folding and setting the dimensional space incrementally; the final seals are applied in a single extended working session
- **Calibration**: Tuning interior properties (time ratio, temperature, light) in the first weeks of use; adjustments become harder once the pocket has been inhabited and the seals have settled

The process is not dangerous to bystanders, but it is deeply exhausting for the mage. Delyra crafted the Fold over approximately four weeks prior to opening Art of Facts — it was the foundational work she completed before taking on her first clients.

## Delyra's Workshop: The Fold

### Character and Layout

The Fold's entrance is a seamless portal in the back of Delyra's Nimbuspire shop — occupying a doorframe that, by all spatial logic, should open into a supply closet. Inside, the scale is immediately wrong in a comfortable way: the ceiling is higher than the building exterior allows, and the proportions feel slightly more generous than the outer dimensions of the shop would permit.

The interior is organized into four zones:

| Zone | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Main Workshop** | Active enchantment production; multiple worktables, dedicated material stations | Central space; where apprentices and journeymen work |
| **Calibration Room** | Precise measurement work; sensitive enchantment operations requiring absolutely controlled conditions | Insulated from the main floor; Delyra works here exclusively for Tier 3+ commissions |
| **Material Vault** | Climate-controlled storage for uncommon and rare planar materials | Time ratio slows material degradation; effectively extends shelf life of rare components |
| **Anteroom** | Entry/exit zone tuned to material-plane properties; safe transition space | Always maintained regardless of interior conditions in other zones |

### Time Ratio and Production

At 7:1, a standard working week inside the Fold (five interior days) accomplishes the equivalent of five weeks of material-plane production. Delyra manages this carefully:

- Apprentices and journeymen work shifts inside the Fold, rotating out to the material plane for rest and personal time
- Not all tasks benefit equally from time acceleration; calculation work, consultation with clients, and material sourcing must happen outside
- The time ratio means that enchantments completed inside the Fold are effectively produced in advance of their calendar due dates — Delyra generally quotes delivery times based on material-plane calendars but holds significant buffer capacity

### Maintenance

The Fold's seals are maintained by Delyra personally. She applies what are functionally Tier 4 seals — not commercially available, tuned to her specific magical signature. No other enchanter can maintain them; they cannot be transferred or inherited. Her routine involves a weekly re-sealing pass on the primary structural anchors and a deeper monthly check on the time-ratio seals, which are the most energetically demanding.

She is aware that if something happened to her — serious illness, injury, death — the Fold would begin declining within days. She has evacuation plans. The anteroom is always the safest exit point.

## Stability and Warning Signs

### Degradation Sequence

A pocket dimension does not fail suddenly without warning. Degradation follows a recognizable sequence:

1. **Dimensional shimmer**: The walls and ceiling of the pocket develop a slight visual instability — not quite flickering, but an impression that the boundaries are not entirely solid. Early sign; the pocket can typically be re-stabilized if caught here.
2. **Temporal stuttering**: Time flow becomes slightly inconsistent — clocks inside run at varying rates relative to outside. Instruments carried between the pocket and material plane show minor discrepancies. This indicates seal stress.
3. **Planar bleed**: The adjacent planes the pocket borrowed from begin exerting influence. A pocket anchored near the fire plane might show rising ambient temperature; one near the shadow realm might develop persistent dim zones. At this stage, evacuation should be considered.
4. **Anchor instability**: Access through the anchor point becomes unreliable — sometimes the portal opens correctly, sometimes not, sometimes it opens partially. Final warning.
5. **Collapse**: The pocket inverts — its interior space fails catastrophically. Contents are ejected through the anchor point (if it is still functioning) or dragged into the adjacent plane toward which the pocket had been drifting during bleed. Collapse events on the material plane can produce spatial ruptures, localized planar weather anomalies, and material damage at the anchor site.

### External Impact of Collapse

Historical pocket dimension collapses are treated as significant magical disasters in guild memory. The spatial ruptures they leave behind can persist for months, creating zones of unstable planar energy. The Aetheric Mages' Compact's prohibition on weaponizing pocket dimensions stems partly from this: a deliberately induced collapse in a populated area would be catastrophic.

## Ecological Applications: Weltina Partnership

### The Concept

Delyra's most unusual dimensional work is not production capacity — it is what she is doing with Weltina Boons at Haven Wildlife Preserve.

Standard pocket dimensions are tuned to be **hospitable to material-plane inhabitants** — stable gravity, comfortable temperature, steady light. What Delyra has begun exploring is the inverse: pockets tuned to be **hospitable to creatures whose home plane is not the material plane**.

A fire elemental housed in a material-plane enclosure is in constant, low-grade physiological distress. It can survive, but it is not thriving. A pocket dimension whose interior is tuned to lean toward the fire plane — warm beyond standard comfort, with ambient fire-plane energy present — would allow that creature to live in something approximating its natural environment while remaining accessible to the material plane through a safe anteroom.

### Technical Structure

A **planar habitat pocket** has two distinct zones separated by a tuned threshold:

| Zone | Properties | Who Enters |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Habitat Zone** | Tuned toward the creature's home plane; temperature, energy, and planar presence calibrated for the creature's comfort | The creature; limited magical access for observation |
| **Anteroom** | Maintained at full material-plane properties; isolated from planar bleed by dedicated seals | Weltina's wardens, veterinary practitioners, visiting researchers |

The anteroom seals are separately maintained from the habitat seals. A failure of the habitat zone — if the pocket drifts too far toward the adjacent plane — does not immediately compromise the anteroom, which provides a survival window for anyone inside.

### Scale and Commitment

These pockets are extraordinary commissions, not services Delyra offers publicly. Each represents:

- **Weeks of site assessment** to find anchor points with appropriate proximity to the target plane
- **Custom shaping** tuned per species and plane — fire plane habitat mechanics differ substantially from ice plane or shadow realm configurations
- **Permanent maintenance obligation** on Delyra's part; these pockets cannot be handed off

She and Weltina are planning **two to three planar habitat pockets at Haven** over the next several years. The first, currently in planning, is for a fire-plane elemental — the anchor site has been selected in a volcanic zone of Haven's grounds, near a natural planar thin point. Each pocket Delyra creates for Weltina is considered a personal conservation gift, not an enchantment commission.

### Species Being Considered

| Creature | Target Plane | Habitat Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Fire Elemental | Fire plane boundary | High ambient heat; sustained combustion-energy presence; anti-condensation seals required in anteroom |
| Frost Wraith | Ice plane boundary | Near-freezing habitat zone; total insulation between zones; limited anteroom duration recommended for wardens |
| Shadow Stalker | Liminal shadow realm | Reduced-light habitat; anteroom requires full-bright seals as psychological barrier; creature must not observe anteroom directly |
| Storm Sprite | Storm layer | High air pressure differential; the most technically complex — storm-layer anchors are energetically volatile |

*The shadow stalker and storm sprite habitats are theoretical; the fire elemental pocket is Delyra's immediate focus.*

## Rare Gifted Applications: Storage

Delyra has on two occasions helped trusted individuals create **permanently gifted storage pockets** — small, stable, time-neutral pockets anchored to a fixed material-plane location and sealed into an artifact object carried by the owner.

These are not commercial offerings. She will not take commissions for them. She considers them personal gifts given for significant professional trust or conservation partnership. Key characteristics:

- **Locale-bound**: anchored to a specific physical location; cannot be moved without Delyra re-anchoring the seals from scratch
- **Time-neutral or slight deceleration**: tuned at 1:1 or slightly slower than material time; items age normally or marginally more slowly
- **Small**: roughly wardrobe-to-chest-room scale; not large enough for a full warehouse operation
- **Permanent** — relative to Delyra's continued health and maintenance capacity; she accepts this ongoing obligation when she grants one

One gifted storage pocket exists in connection with Bran Brightwood's operations, created to hold a small consignment of particularly rare and fragile planar materials during a complex transit arrangement. It is considered a personal favor between them, not a service contract.

## Portal Gates vs. Pocket Dimensions

These two concepts are frequently confused. They are mechanically unrelated:

| | Portal Gate | Pocket Dimension |
|--|------------|-----------------|
| **What it is** | A doorway between two material-plane locations | An interior space that exists between planes |
| **Practitioner requirement** | A skilled mage; not the rarest tier | One of the rarest magical abilities in the world |
| **Stability source** | Anchor enchantment at both ends; can be maintained by enchanters | Creator's personal seals; cannot be maintained by anyone else |
| **Maintenance** | Portal Anchor Maintenance Seal (Tier 3, 800 AC, annual) | Delyra's personal re-sealing; not commercially available |
| **What's on the other side** | A real location in the material world | A separate dimensional space |
| **Transfer or inheritance** | Anchor can be re-keyed to a new mage or organization | Collapses on the creator's death unless artifact-anchored |

**Delyra's five shops** (Nimbuspire, Goldentarn, Brasshollow, Stonegate, Bellharbor) are connected by portal gates. Customers who walk through the door in Goldentarn and emerge in Stonegate are moving between real buildings through a planar aperture. The annual Port Anchor Maintenance Seals on these gates are Delyra's largest single line item in enchantment upkeep.

**The Fold** is the only pocket dimension she maintains. It is accessible only through the Nimbuspire shop.

## Cultural and Legal Standing

### Cultural Attitude

Pocket dimensions are regarded with a mixture of awe, unease, and mythological weight. Common people understand them primarily through legend — the stories of archmages who kept private worlds, who could not die easily because no one could find them, who emerged from nowhere. The knowledge that there are living practitioners is not widely publicized; guild circles are aware, but it is not the kind of information tradespeople discuss over ale.

Among magical scholars and practitioners, a mage known to have crafted a pocket dimension occupies an immediate tier of respect that no certification can replicate. It is evidence of capacity that speaks for itself. Delyra's status among enchantment guild members is partly explained by this — they know what her workshop represents, even if clients do not always.

### Legal Framework

Because there have never been enough practitioners to constitute an industry, no kingdom has ever built comprehensive regulatory law around pocket dimension creation or operation. What exists is informal:

| Situation | Legal Standing |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Mage-crafted personal pocket** | Treated as personal property of the mage; no registration required; no kingdom has the means to enforce a registry even if one existed |
| **Natural pocket** (discovered) | Immediately claimed as territorial property by whichever kingdom's land it falls within; treated as a royal resource |
| **Artifact-anchored Legacy Pocket** | Inherited under the laws of the kingdom where it is located; subject to treasure law in most kingdoms; can be seized as a crown asset if the owning house falls |
| **Gifted storage pocket** | Informal personal property of the recipient; legal status as novel as the artifact that anchors it; no test case law exists |

The Aetheric Mages' Compact maintains three informal prohibitions that its members observe through professional ethics rather than legal enforcement:
1. No deliberate induction of pocket collapse in a populated area
2. No undisclosed pocket creation within the sovereign territory of a kingdom without that kingdom's consent (the courtesy of notification is expected, though not legally required)
3. No use of pocket time-dilation to significantly advantage one party in a commercial dispute where the counterparty does not know this advantage exists

Delyra operates within all three without difficulty. Her pockets are disclosed, her work is kept separate from contract timing disputes, and she has no interest in dimensional weaponization.
