## Overview

This document defines the taxonomy, mechanics, and commercial applications of enchantments in Nubimancy. Delyra Voss's businesses specialize in enchantment refresh and maintenance as a service industry. Understanding enchantment types, decay rates, and refresh methods is essential for demo data generation across the Delyra extension group and for cross-hero dependencies (ale preservation for Thorin, scroll integrity for Bran).

## Enchantment Classification System

### By Application Domain
- **Preservation Enchantments** — Temperature control, freshness stasis, decay prevention (ale, scrolls, organic materials)
- **Enhancement Enchantments** — Strength, speed, sharpness, luminosity applied to items or locations
- **Warding Enchantments** — Protection against threats, intrusion, environmental hazards
- **Planar Enchantments** — Dimensional stabilization, pocket space maintenance, portal anchoring
- **Communication Enchantments** — Scrying links, message relays, aethernet connections

### By Magical Tier
- **[To be completed]** — Tier 1: Common enchantments (wide availability, low cost, short lifespan)
- **[To be completed]** — Tier 2: Skilled enchantments (guild-certified, moderate cost, 30–90 day lifespan)
- **[To be completed]** — Tier 3: Master enchantments (rare, expensive, 6–24 month lifespan)
- **[To be completed]** — Tier 4: Legendary enchantments (unique, extremely rare, indefinite with maintenance)

### By Lunar Alignment Dependency
- **[To be completed]** — Silvara-aligned enchantments (properties, best application windows)
- **[To be completed]** — Coprus-aligned enchantments (properties, best application windows)
- **[To be completed]** — Dual-moon enchantments (requires both moons' alignment, rare, powerful)
- **[To be completed]** — Moon-neutral enchantments (reliable year-round, slightly less potent)

## Enchantment Lifecycle and Decay

### Decay Mechanics
- **[To be completed]** — Base lifespan by enchantment type and tier
- **[To be completed]** — Decay rate factors (environmental exposure, usage intensity, material compatibility)
- **[To be completed]** — Threshold definitions: Full → Moderate → Low → Critical → Expired
- **[To be completed]** — Consequences of reaching Critical/Expired state per enchantment type

### Monitoring and Detection
- **[To be completed]** — Methods for assessing enchantment health (visual indicators, crystal tablet readings)
- **[To be completed]** — Automated vs. manual inspection schedules
- **[To be completed]** — Emergency detection triggers

## Refresh and Renewal Services

### Standard Refresh Methods
- **[To be completed]** — Method A: In-situ refresh (on-site service, moderate cost, works for most tiers)
- **[To be completed]** — Method B: Workshop refresh (item brought to Delyra's facility, preferred for high-tier)
- **[To be completed]** — Method C: Remote scrying-assisted refresh (distance service, limited effectiveness)

### Rush Refresh Services
- **[To be completed]** — Rush eligibility criteria (minimum enchantment health, enchantment types supported)
- **[To be completed]** — Rush premium multipliers
- **[To be completed]** — SLA expectations by tier

### Lunar Alignment Scheduling
- **[To be completed]** — Enchantments requiring specific moon phases for optimal refresh
- **[To be completed]** — Scheduling implications for Delyra's service calendar
- **[To be completed]** — Emergency refresh outside optimal windows (cost and effectiveness penalties)

## Crafting and Application

### Who Can Apply Enchantments
- **[To be completed]** — Guild certification requirements (which guild, which tier)
- **[To be completed]** — Unlicensed enchanting — legality, consequences, black market context
- **[To be completed]** — Apprentice vs. journeyman vs. master crafter distinctions

### Multiplanar Crafting Advantages
- **[To be completed]** — How dimensional work centers (DelyraMultiplanarWorkCenters) accelerate production
- **[To be completed]** — Time acceleration ratios and their narrative explanation
- **[To be completed]** — Rare materials only available via planar sourcing

### Material Requirements by Enchantment Type
- **[To be completed]** — Common materials (widely available, low cost)
- **[To be completed]** — Uncommon materials (regional sources, moderate cost)
- **[To be completed]** — Rare planar materials (requires multiplanar work center access or Bran's routes)

## Commercial Market Structure

### Enchantment Service Market
- **[To be completed]** — Major competitors to Delyra's service offering
- **[To be completed]** — Pricing norms: cost per refresh by enchantment type and tier
- **[To be completed]** — Service contract structures (one-time vs. subscription/retainer)
- **[To be completed]** — Volume discount expectations

### Portal Shop Retail (DelyraPortalShopManagement)
- **[To be completed]** — What items are sold through portal shops vs. direct service
- **[To be completed]** — Enchanted item categories and typical inventory
- **[To be completed]** — Pricing premiums for portal-location convenience
