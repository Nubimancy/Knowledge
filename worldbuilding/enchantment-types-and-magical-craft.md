# Enchantment Types and Magical Craft

**Status:** 🟡 Framework — Content filled; guild certification details pending `guilds.md`
**Priority:** CRITICAL — Core business domain for DelyraEnchantmentRefreshServices, DelyraMultiplanarWorkCenters, DelyraPortalShopManagement
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

## Overview

This document defines the taxonomy, mechanics, and commercial applications of enchantments in Nubimancy. Delyra's Art of Facts is built on a central belief: magic should be trustworthy, affordable, and useful to ordinary people — not just those wealthy enough to afford a wizard.

Because enchantment is **item-based magic** (not personal spellcasting), anyone can benefit from an enchanted item without magical ability of their own. This is its great democratizing power. A farmer's family can have a freshness charm on their root cellar. A blacksmith can have an ever-sharp chisel. A caravan guard can have a ward on their shield. Delyra's mission is to ensure those items are genuine, properly made, and reasonably priced — and that the post-plague charlatan economy doesn't poison that trust.

Understanding enchantment types, decay rates, and refresh methods is essential for demo data generation across the Delyra extension group and for cross-hero dependencies (ale preservation for Thorin, scroll integrity for Bran, arena equipment for Rini, component sourcing for Weltina).

## Enchantment Classification System

### By Application Domain

Five primary domains cover the full range of enchantment commerce. Most Art of Facts catalog items fall into Preservation and Enhancement; Warding and Planar are the high-margin professional and institutional lines.

| Domain | What It Does | Primary Customers | Cross-Hero Link |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Preservation** | Temperature control, freshness stasis, decay prevention for organic materials | Households, farmers, merchants, Thorin (ale), Bran (scrolls) | Thorin's barrels, Bran's cargo |
| **Enhancement** | Strength, speed, sharpness, luminosity, precision applied to tools or spaces | Craftspeople, smiths, farmers, professionals | General trade; Rini's arena equipment |
| **Warding** | Protection against physical threats, intrusion, environmental hazards, vermin | Households, merchants, military, Bran (wagons), governments | Bran's caravan wards |
| **Planar** | Dimensional stabilization, pocket space maintenance, portal anchoring | Delyra's own operations; rare institutional clients | Core to Delyra's workshop; portal shops |
| **Communication** | Scrying links, message relays, crystal-to-crystal connections | Merchants, governments, wealthy households, Rini (broadcasting) | Rini's broadcasting network |

---

### By Magical Tier

Tier determines required crafter skill, material cost, item lifespan, and retail price. The tier system is Art of Facts' quality classification standard and is now informally recognized as the industry norm.

#### Tier 1 — Common Enchantments

**Who makes them:** Licensed apprentices under supervision, or journeyman enchanters  
**Availability:** Widely available through Art of Facts shops and licensed independent crafters  
**Lifespan:** 30–90 days without refresh  
**Price range:** 5–30 Aurumvale Crowns  
**Typical users:** Everyday households, small traders, farms, small workshops

These are the heart of Delyra's accessibility mission. A skilled craftsperson earns roughly 1.2 AC per day (~432 AC/year); a common laborer earns 0.6 AC per day (~216 AC/year). An 8 AC freshness charm represents about a week's wages for a laborer — a meaningful but very plannable household expenditure, equivalent to setting aside a small amount each week over a season.

| Item Name | Domain | What It Does | Lifespan | Price (AC) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Freshness Charm** (small) | Preservation | Keeps food cool and fresh in a larder, box, or small barrel; slows spoilage by ~3× | 60 days | 8 |
| **Freshness Charm** (large) | Preservation | Full root cellar or merchant storage room; slows spoilage by ~3× | 45 days | 18 |
| **Flameless Lantern** | Enhancement | Steady warm light without flame; no fire risk; adjustable brightness | 90 days | 12 |
| **Ever-Sharp Chisel / Blade** | Enhancement | Maintains edge quality; no dulling under normal use | 60 days | 10 |
| **Warming Stone** | Preservation | Radiates gentle heat; warms a small room or sleeping area | 45 days | 14 |
| **Cooling Stone** | Preservation | Keeps a defined space cool; good for butter, medicines, drinks | 45 days | 14 |
| **Pest Ward** (small) | Warding | Deters rodents and insects from a defined area (larder, grain store) | 60 days | 9 |
| **Cleaning Brush** | Enhancement | Scrubbing brush that loosens grime with minimal effort; reduces cleaning time by half | 75 days | 7 |
| **Animal Calm Charm** | Enhancement | Soothes anxious or agitated animals; used for stabled horses, livestock handling | 45 days | 11 |
| **Herb Preservation Bundle** | Preservation | Dried herbs retain potency and fragrance; used by healers and cooks | 90 days | 6 |
| **Loom Tension Keeper** | Enhancement | Maintains even tension on a weaving loom; reduces thread breakage | 60 days | 13 |
| **Bright Workbench Stone** | Enhancement | Focused bright light for close craft work (leatherwork, jewellery, surgery) | 75 days | 10 |
| **Broadcast Receiving Crystal** (audio) | Communication | Receives a regional audio scrying relay; plays live voice narration from a distant event; tavern and public hall standard | 90 days | 20–40 |

---

#### Tier 2 — Skilled Enchantments

**Who makes them:** Journeyman enchanters with guild certification; supervised senior apprentices for some types  
**Availability:** Art of Facts shops (primary source); a small number of independent certified enchanters  
**Lifespan:** 90–365 days without refresh  
**Price range:** 40–150 Aurumvale Crowns  
**Typical users:** Commercial traders, skilled professionals, farms with significant output, taverns, Thorin's standard distribution barrels

| Item Name | Domain | What It Does | Lifespan | Price (AC) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Preservation Barrel** (standard) | Preservation | Keeps ale, foodstuffs, or perishable goods at stable optimal temperature; extends shelf life significantly | 180 days | 55 |
| **Cargo Ward** (wagon) | Warding | Protects wagon cargo from weather, minor impacts, and opportunistic theft attempts | 120 days | 70 |
| **Healing Salve Vessel** | Preservation | Keeps medicinal compounds, poultices, and healing salves at full potency | 180 days | 45 |
| **Animal Health Charm** (herd) | Enhancement | Applied to a stable or enclosure; promotes general health, reduces illness transmission among animals | 90 days | 80 |
| **Precision Scale** | Enhancement | Enchanted measurement tool; maintains calibration; used by merchants and apothecaries | 365 days | 95 |
| **Communication Crystal** (pair) | Communication | Two matched crystals allowing short-range voice communication (~50 km range) | 180 days | 120 |
| **Ward Stone** (building perimeter) | Warding | Protects a building perimeter; alerts owner to intrusion; minor deterrent effect | 120 days | 90 |
| **Forge Bellows Enhancement** | Enhancement | Maintains consistent forge temperature; reduces fuel consumption by ~30% | 180 days | 110 |
| **Scrying Mirror** (short-range) | Communication | Point-to-point: allows one-way visual observation of one specific pre-linked location (warehouse, shop, estate gate); private use only; not capable of receiving broadcast signals | 150 days | 135 |

---

#### Tier 3 — Master Enchantments

**Who makes them:** Master enchanters only; Delyra personally crafts or directly supervises all Tier 3 production  
**Availability:** Art of Facts exclusively; no independent competitor offers reliable Tier 3  
**Lifespan:** 1–3 years without refresh  
**Price range:** 200–800 Aurumvale Crowns  
**Typical users:** Wealthy merchants, noble households, institutions, Rini's arena infrastructure, Bran's high-priority cargo, Thorin's premium preservation

| Item Name | Domain | What It Does | Lifespan | Price (AC) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Preservation Vault** (room-scale) | Preservation | Industrial-grade temperature and freshness stasis for a full storage room; used by Thorin's regional hubs | 2 years | 400 |
| **Protective Ward** (full structure) | Warding | Comprehensive warding of a building; intruder alert, material protection, minor combat deterrence | 18 months | 600 |
| **Arena Scoring System** | Enhancement | Measures contact, impact force, and hit location for competitive scoring; used in Rini's arenas | 2 years | 550 |
| **Long-Range Communication Array** | Communication | Crystal network linking multiple locations with clear voice transmission up to 500 km | 1 year | 700 |
| **Fighter Protective Ward** (personal) | Warding | Wearable ward providing meaningful protection against injury; worn by elite fighters | 120 days (intense use) | 250 |
| **Visual Broadcast Receiver Panel** | Communication | Large enchanted mirror or crystal panel that receives and displays a live visual scrying broadcast signal (one-to-many); candlelight-quality image; required infrastructure for gambling houses and noble viewing rooms; distinct from point-to-point Scrying Mirrors | 1 year | 300–600 (installation) |
| **Portal Anchor Maintenance Seal** | Planar | Annual materials cost to prepare and stabilize a portal anchor space; applied at each anchor point (both ends of a gate); covers the fixed infrastructure cost of keeping the portal ready | 1 year | 800 (annual) |
| **Elven Ale Preservation** (specialist) | Preservation | Required for distributing delicate elven ales; maintains fermentation culture integrity | 90 days | 220 |
| **Healing Ward** (infirmary-scale) | Enhancement | Applied to a medical space; promotes faster recovery, reduces infection risk; used by healers and Haven | 1 year | 480 |

**Portal cost structure (two components):**
Portal usage involves both a fixed annual cost and a variable per-use cost:
- **Annual anchor maintenance (800 AC/year):** The Portal Anchor Maintenance Seal above. Covers materials to prepare and stabilize each anchor point. Required at both ends of any permanent or semi-permanent gate. Delyra's five inter-shop portal gates each require this annually; it is her largest single enchantment upkeep line item.
- **Per-use reagent cost (200–500 AC per opening):** Materials consumed each time a portal is actually opened. Applies to on-demand mage-opened portals. For permanent gates (like Delyra's inter-shop network), the ambient enchantment absorbs this; there is no meaningful per-use cost once the gate is maintained.

For clients hiring a portal mage for a one-time opening, the combined service fee (reagents + mage's professional fee) typically runs 800–1,500 AC total. See `magic-systems.md` for portal travel constraints and availability.

---

#### Tier 4 — Legendary Enchantments

**Who makes them:** Delyra alone  
**Availability:** Commission-only; never catalog items; waitlist typically 3–9 months  
**Lifespan:** Indefinite with scheduled maintenance (see Refresh Services)  
**Price range:** 1,500–10,000+ Aurumvale Crowns; noble and institutional clients  
**Typical users:** Kingdom governments, noble patrons, unique institutional needs, Delyra's own operational infrastructure

Tier 4 enchantments are not products in any conventional sense — they are bespoke magical works negotiated directly with Delyra. Each has a unique character and cannot be standardly catalogued. Examples include:

- **The Deepmarket Cooling Vault** (Underhelm) — Enchanted cold-storage for the dwarven Grand Kegfest; maintains temperature for 400+ barrels simultaneously; ongoing Port & Pour partnership
- **Nimbuspire Academy Communication Array** — Multi-node crystal network connecting across the floating city campus; Delyra's most complex communication installation
- **Dimensional Work Center Stabilization Seals** — The enchantments maintaining Delyra's own pocket dimension workshop; she maintains these personally; not available commercially
- **The Pinnacle League Arena Safety Array** (The Peak) — Combined safety ward, environmental control, and scoring system for the championship arena accessed only by portal
- **Royal Protective Ward Renewal** (Aurumvale palace) — Ongoing maintenance contract for the palace's original warding; Delyra inherited the contract from the previous enchanter

### By Lunar Alignment Dependency

The two-moon system (Silvara, 28-day cycle; Coprus, 20-day cycle) creates scheduling patterns that enchanters must account for. Art of Facts uses a lunar scheduling module in Business Central to optimize production timing.

| Category | Description | Enchantment Types | Scheduling Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Silvara-aligned** | Best applied or refreshed during Silvara's waxing-to-full phase; more stable, longer lifespan when timed correctly | Preservation enchantments, Healing wards, Communication arrays | +15–20% lifespan vs. off-phase; Delyra schedules bulk Tier 2+ preservation runs during this window |
| **Coprus-aligned** | Best applied during Coprus waxing-to-full; produces more intense and reactive effects | Warding enchantments, Enhancement enchantments (strength/speed focus) | +10–15% effectiveness; fighter wards and cargo wards prefer this window |
| **Dual-moon** | Requires both moons waxing near-simultaneously; rare alignment; significantly more powerful results | Tier 3–4 items requiring maximum potency; landmark enchantments | Occurs roughly 4–5 times per year; Delyra reserves these windows for the most important commissions |
| **Moon-neutral** | Can be applied at any point in both cycles; marginally less potent but consistently reliable | Tier 1 everyday items; flameless lanterns, cleaning tools, most utility items | Allows year-round production scheduling without calendar dependency; important for catalog items |

**Conjunction period (both moons dark, ~every 140 days):**  
No enchanting is performed during the Conjunction. The magical resonance is unpredictable; enchantments applied during this period have high failure rates and unstable lifespans. Art of Facts closes its workshops for 2–3 days around each Conjunction. This is considered good practice and is formally recommended by the Enchanters' Guild.

---

## Everyday Enchantments and the Household Market

Delyra is explicit about this: the most important part of Art of Facts' mission is making magic accessible to ordinary people. The post-plague charlatan market sold fake magic to desperate people who couldn't tell real from fraudulent. Rebuilding that trust means showing up reliably, affordably, and transparently in the everyday market.

### Typical Household Enchantment Spending

An average middle-income household might maintain 2–4 active enchantments at any time:

| Household Type | Typical Enchantments | Annual Spend Estimate (AC) |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Small farm family** | Freshness charm (larder), pest ward, animal calm charm (rotation), herb bundle | 35–55 AC/year |
| **Town craftsperson household** | Freshness charm, flameless lantern, ever-sharp tools (1–2), cleaning brush | 40–60 AC/year |
| **Merchant household** | Freshness charm (large), flameless lanterns (2), precision scale, ward stone | 130–160 AC/year |
| **Prosperous estate** | Preservation vault (or multiple Tier 2), full building ward, communication crystal pair, healing salve vessel | 500–900 AC/year |

At 1.2 AC/day for a skilled craftsperson (~432 AC/year) or 0.6 AC/day for a common laborer (~216 AC/year), a modest household spending 40–50 AC/year on enchantments is allocating roughly 10–20% of annual income — comparable to a major seasonal purchase. Delyra considers this a reasonable and defensible ask, and a significant improvement over the pre-Art-of-Facts situation where families either bought bogus charms or had no access at all. *Note: household spending figures here are indicative; a full economic calibration pass is planned.*

### Authentication and Consumer Protection

Every Art of Facts catalog item carries a **certification seal** — a small secondary enchantment that identifies the item as genuine and records its production date and initial enchantment health. Customers can bring any item to any Art of Facts shop to have the seal read for free. This is deliberately a loss-leader service: the goal is to make authentication universal so that buyers learn to *expect* a seal, and charlatans selling unsealed items become visibly suspect.

---

## Enchantment Lifecycle and Decay

### Decay Mechanics

All enchantments decay over time. Decay rate reflects the gradual dissipation of the magical binding that holds the enchantment to the item. It is neither a flaw nor a failure — it is the natural behaviour of enchantment, and the principle on which Art of Facts' refresh service business is built.

**Base lifespan by tier (undisturbed, ideal conditions):**

| Tier | Base Lifespan Range | Notes |
|------|--------------------|----|
| Tier 1 | 30–90 days | Varies significantly by enchantment type and material substrate |
| Tier 2 | 90–365 days | Quality materials and correct lunar timing push toward upper end |
| Tier 3 | 1–3 years | Delyra's craftsmanship reliably reaches full range |
| Tier 4 | Indefinite | Degrade only if not maintained on schedule; Delyra maintains personally |

**Decay rate accelerants:**
- **Environmental exposure:** Heat, cold extremes, damp, and direct magical interference all accelerate decay; preservation enchantments on items outdoors or in harsh conditions decay 20–40% faster
- **Usage intensity:** Actively-used items (fighter wards in combat, tool enhancements in daily use) decay faster than passive items (a stored freshness charm on a sealed larder)
- **Material incompatibility:** Inferior base materials (low-quality iron, softwood, impure glass) hold enchantment less well; Tier 1 applied to quality materials may outlast Tier 1 on cheap materials by 50%
- **Proximity to the Conjunction:** Enchantments applied in the week before the Conjunction show slightly accelerated early decay; Art of Facts advises refreshing critical items after the Conjunction period rather than before

---

### Health Thresholds

Art of Facts uses a five-level health scale, readable from the certification seal or via a journeyman's assessment:

| Level | % Remaining | Visual Indicator | Recommended Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Full** | 80–100% | Seal glows warmly; no visible fading | None; standard expiry tracking |
| **Moderate** | 50–79% | Seal slightly dimmed | Schedule refresh within the next service window |
| **Low** | 25–49% | Seal noticeably dim; faint colour shift | Book refresh promptly; effectiveness is reduced |
| **Critical** | 1–24% | Seal nearly dark; item may show physical signs | Immediate refresh required; item may fail unexpectedly |
| **Expired** | 0% | Seal dark and inert | Enchantment fully dissipated; item is mundane |

**Consequences of Critical/Expired state by domain:**
- **Preservation expired:** Food spoils at natural rate; ale begins degrading; no temperature control remains
- **Enhancement expired:** Tool reverts to mundane quality; loom tension drops; lantern goes dark
- **Warding expired:** Full vulnerability to what was being warded against; cargo unprotected; building perimeter open
- **Communication expired:** Crystal goes dark; no transmission possible
- **Planar expired:** Dimensional stability at risk; portal anchor requires emergency professional service (high cost)

---

### Monitoring and Detection

**Standard assessment methods:**
- **Seal reading** — Any Art of Facts-certified item can be assessed in under a minute by any journeyman; customers can also bring items to any shop for a free health check
- **Crystal tablet reading** — Art of Facts provides a small handheld crystal tablet to Tier 2+ commercial clients (Thorin's Caskwardens, Bran's caravan Captains); allows field health-checks without visiting a shop
- **Visual indicators** — Experienced users learn to recognise dimming, colour shifts, and reduced effectiveness without formal assessment; included in Art of Facts' client education materials

**Recommended inspection schedules by context:**
- Household Tier 1 items: Check at mid-lifespan (day 30–45 for most items); book refresh if at Moderate
- Commercial Tier 2 items: Monthly inspection; Caskwardens include in standard delivery rounds
- Institutional Tier 3 items: Quarterly formal inspection by Art of Facts journeyman; logged in BC service records
- Tier 4 items: Delyra reviews personally on agreed schedule (typically twice yearly per item)

**Emergency detection triggers:**
- Rapid unexpected dimming of the seal (indicates environmental damage or magical interference)
- Sudden loss of expected effect (freshness charm failing while seal still shows Moderate — requires investigation)
- Physical damage to the enchanted substrate (cracked barrel stave, bent tool) can disrupt the enchantment's binding and should trigger immediate assessment regardless of health reading

---

## Refresh and Renewal Services

Refresh services are Art of Facts' most reliable recurring revenue stream and the service Delyra personally considers most important. A refreshed enchantment is not re-enchanted from scratch — the existing magical binding is reinforced and extended, costing less in materials and time than a new item while restoring the item to Full health.

### Standard Refresh Methods

**Method A: In-Situ Refresh (On-Site)**  
A journeyman or master enchanter travels to the client's location and refreshes the item in place. Preferred for large, immovable items (storage rooms, building wards, arena installations).  
- Works for: Tier 1–3 preservation, warding, enhancement  
- Cost: Base refresh fee + travel cost (varies by distance from nearest shop)  
- Lead time: 3–10 days for standard scheduling  
- Limitation: Cannot achieve full Dual-Moon timing benefit in the field

**Method B: Workshop Refresh**  
Client brings the item to any Art of Facts shop location for workshop processing. Preferred for valuable objects where optimal lunar timing is worth waiting for.  
- Works for: All tiers  
- Cost: Base refresh fee only (no travel surcharge)  
- Lead time: 2–14 days depending on tier and lunar scheduling  
- Advantage: Restores to 100% health; can incorporate material upgrades; extends base lifespan by 10–20% over in-situ  
- Process: Item is assessed on arrival, logged in BC, processed in the pocket dimension workshop, returned via portal or pickup

**Method C: Remote Scrying-Assisted Refresh**  
Delyra or a senior journeyman provides guided refresh instructions via scrying crystal while the client performs minor steps. Only viable for Tier 1 items with a moderately skilled operator.  
- Works for: Tier 1 only; client must be able to follow exact instructions  
- Cost: 50–60% of standard in-situ fee  
- Lead time: Appointment scheduled within 1–3 days  
- Limitation: Restores to maximum 70% health; lunar timing cannot be controlled; not recommended for items below Low health threshold

---

### Rush Refresh Services

Rush refresh is available for Critical-health items where waiting is not an option (a caravan departing the next morning, a failing building ward, ale shipment at risk).

**Rush eligibility criteria:**
- Item must be at Low or Critical health (Full and Moderate do not qualify for rush)
- All enchantment domains supported except Planar (Planar emergencies require specialist response, not rush refresh)
- Tier 1–3 supported; Tier 4 rush handled as a direct Delyra consultation

**Rush premium multipliers:**

| Request Window | Premium | Notes |
|----------------|---------|-------|
| Within 48 hours | +50% | Standard rush |
| Within 24 hours | +100% | Same-day emergency |
| Within 6 hours | +200% | On-call emergency; senior staff only |

**SLA expectations by tier:**
- Tier 1 rush: Completed within the requested window at any shop  
- Tier 2 rush: Available at Goldentarn, Nimbuspire, Stonegate; may require portal transfer from other locations  
- Tier 3 rush: Handled only at Goldentarn (nearest to workshop); Delyra or lead journeyman performs

---

### Lunar Alignment Scheduling

Art of Facts publishes a monthly **Enchantment Calendar** to commercial clients, marking optimal windows for each enchantment domain. This is one of the services that differentiates Art of Facts from informal enchanters who don't track lunar timing.

**Scheduling patterns:**
- **Silvara waxing → full (days 7–14 of 28-day cycle):** Preservation and communication refresh batch window; Thorin's barrel refresh orders are clustered here
- **Coprus waxing → full (days 5–10 of 20-day cycle):** Warding and enhancement refresh window; Bran's protective ward renewals scheduled here
- **Dual-moon waxing alignment (~4–5 times/year):** Reserved for new Tier 3 commissions and the highest-priority Tier 2 commercial orders; waiting list managed in BC

**Emergency refresh outside optimal windows:**  
Refresh performed outside optimal lunar windows is still effective; it simply does not achieve the extended lifespan bonus. Clients booking emergency or rush refresh outside window periods should expect:
- 10–20% shorter lifespan on the refreshed enchantment
- No effectiveness penalty — the enchantment performs at Full health immediately after refresh
- Cost is not discounted for off-window timing; in-cycle timing is a benefit of advance planning, not a premium for optimal booking

## Crafting and Application

### Who Can Apply Enchantments

Enchanting requires innate magical ability (unlike using an enchanted item, which requires none). The Enchanters' Guild provides the certification framework; Art of Facts requires all staff to be Guild-certified at the appropriate tier.

| Role | Guild Certification | What They Can Produce | Delyra's Usage |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| **Apprentice Enchanter** | Guild trainee (not yet certified) | Practice items only; no commercial production | Supervised workshop production under journeyman oversight |
| **Journeyman Enchanter** | Guild Journeyman Certificate | Tier 1 independently; Tier 2 under master supervision | Art of Facts' main production workforce; 8–12 on staff |
| **Master Enchanter** | Guild Master Certificate | Tier 1–2 independently; Tier 3 under grandmaster oversight | 3 senior staff; handle Tier 3 in-situ services |
| **Grandmaster / Art of Facts standard** | Guild Grandmaster (or Delyra's equivalent) | All tiers | Delyra; all Tier 4 and supervision of all Tier 3 |

**Unlicensed enchanting:**
- Illegal in Aurumvale, Aetheros, and Underhelm (the kingdoms with the strongest Guild enforcement)
- In practice, tolerated in frontier regions (Fenroth, Bramblewyn, Siroccane) where Guild presence is minimal
- The post-plague charlatan market exploited unlicensed enchanting as cover for outright fraud — selling mundane items as "enchanted by a hedge mage" with no accountability
- Art of Facts' authentication service can identify items made with unlicensed enchanting (they lack the correct material signature and are often structurally inferior); used as evidence in fraud cases
- **Black market enchanting** exists in most major cities; quality is inconsistent and dangerous; protective warding items from black-market sources have a documented failure rate under stress

---

### Multiplanar Crafting Advantages

Delyra's pocket dimension workshop is not simply a convenience — it is a fundamental competitive advantage with no equivalent anywhere else.

**Time acceleration ratio:**  
The workshop's interior operates at approximately **7:1 time ratio** — one day in the material plane corresponds to roughly seven days of production time inside the pocket dimension. In practice:
- A Tier 2 custom commission that would take a skilled enchanter 2 weeks of real time is completed in approximately 2 days of the client's wait time
- Tier 3 commissions that would otherwise require months of careful work are completed in weeks
- The workshop allows multiple enchantment stages (material preparation, core binding, layering, curing, testing) to be performed with careful sequential timing that simply isn't feasible in normal time flow

**Why this matters for quality:**  
Many enchanting failures result from rushing the curing and layering stages. The pocket dimension allows Delyra's enchanters to take what would be "too much time" in the commercial market and make it economically viable. The result: a quantifiably better enchantment that holds longer, decays more predictably, and performs more consistently than anything a standard workshop can produce.

**Rare materials only available via planar sourcing:**  
The pocket dimension also provides access to materials that exist in dimensional boundary zones and cannot be sourced in the material plane:
- **Boundary Silk** — a translucent fibrous material found at dimensional edges; used in Tier 3–4 planar enchantments; no substitute
- **Void Crystal flakes** — microscopic crystalline fragments from pocket dimension walls; improve lifespan of preservation enchantments significantly; used in Thorin's highest-grade preservation barrels
- **Resonance Dust** — a natural byproduct of time-differential zones; incorporated into communication arrays to improve clarity and range

---

### Material Requirements by Enchantment Type

**Common materials (Tier 1 — widely available, low cost):**
- Silver dust (binding component; mined across most kingdoms)
- Beeswax and pine resin (base carriers for minor enchantments)
- Quartz crystals (small; used in communication and light enchantments)
- Dried moonflower petals (Silvara-aligned preservation; grows widely in temperate climates)
- Iron filings (Coprus-aligned warding base)

**Uncommon materials (Tier 2 — regional sources, moderate cost):**
- Starfire glass (formed from lightning-struck sand; used in enhancement enchantments; primary source: Ashford volcanic region)
- Glacial meltwater crystals (slow-frozen mineral formations from Frostmere and Durnholde high mountains; critical for cooling preservation enchantments)
- Deep-sea kelp ash (coastal ingredient from Thalassor and Bellharbor; used in communication and scrying enchantments)
- Ironskin beetle carapace (sustainable harvest through Weltina's Haven; used in Tier 2 warding; excellent material compatibility)

**Rare planar materials (Tier 3–4 — requires multiplanar access or Bran's routes):**
- **Boundary Silk** (see above; dimensional sourcing only)
- **Void Crystal flakes** (see above; dimensional sourcing only)
- **Dream Crystal shards** (Starhollow quarries; limited and expensive; used in Tier 3 communication arrays and Tier 4 bespoke items)
- **Thornmere Alchemical Salt** (volcanic alchemical extraction; exported in small quantities; dramatically extends preservation enchantment lifespan in organic containers)
- **Ashwood Ember Resin** (from Ashford; required for the highest-grade heat-resistance wards; Delyra buys the entire annual supply)

## Commercial Market Structure

### Enchantment Service Market

**The competitive landscape post-plague:**

Before the Twilight Plague, a functional although inconsistent market existed — Guild-certified enchanters served professional and institutional clients, while the household market was underserved. Post-plague, the charlatan surge temporarily destroyed consumer trust. Art of Facts entered this environment as the credible alternative with the most powerful endorsement possible (a world-saving hero) and a production advantage no competitor could replicate.

| Competitor Type | Market Segment | Threat Level | Delyra's Response |
|----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Independent Guild enchanters** | Tier 2 professional; some Tier 3 | Low-Medium | Quality and speed advantage; friendly coexistence for niche specialists |
| **Charlatan sellers** | Household Tier 1 (fake items) | High (trust damage) | Authentication service as counter-weapon; certification seal as market standard |
| **Black-market enchanters** | Tier 1–2 cut-price | Medium | Quality failure word-of-mouth; Guild enforcement cooperation |
| **Noble household enchanters** (in-house staff) | Tier 3–4 private | Low | Does not compete for public commissions; occasional referral for overflows |

**Pricing norms — refresh fees (Aurumvale Crowns):**

| Tier | Standard In-Situ | Workshop (Method B) | Remote (Method C) |
|------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Tier 1 | 3–6 AC | 2–5 AC | 2–3 AC (max 70% restore) |
| Tier 2 | 12–30 AC | 10–25 AC | Not available |
| Tier 3 | 60–150 AC | 50–120 AC | Not available |
| Tier 4 | Negotiated (Delyra personally) | — | — |

**Service contract structures:**

Art of Facts offers two contracting models that map to BC's subscription/retainer patterns:

- **Annual Maintenance Contract** — Client pays a fixed annual fee for scheduled refresh of all enrolled items; fee is approximately 70% of the sum of individual refresh fees for the contracted items (30% discount for commitment and scheduling predictability); Thorin's Port & Pour regional hubs operate on this model
- **On-Demand Service** — Pay per refresh at standard rates; no commitment; standard for household clients and small traders
- **Volume Refresh Agreement** — For clients managing large numbers of similar items (e.g. Bran's caravan fleet — 12 wagon set of protective wards refreshed together); flat rate per item for batch processing; 20–25% savings vs. individual

### Portal Shop Retail

**What is sold through shops vs. direct service:**

| Through Shops (Catalog) | Through Direct Service Engagement |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| All Tier 1 items (standard catalog) | All Tier 4 commissions |
| Standard Tier 2 catalog items | Institutional Tier 3 installations |
| Authentication seal reading (free) | On-site in-situ refresh for large installations |
| Refresh service intake (any tier) | Apprenticeship enrollment |
| Material components (sold to enchanters) | Pocket dimension workshop tours |
| Certification documentation | Expert authentication for trade disputes |

**Shop inventory by location character:**

- **Nimbuspire** — Heavy emphasis on Tier 2–3 research tools, communication arrays, arcane instruments; highest concentration of Tier 3 catalog items
- **Goldentarn** — Full catalog plus custom commission consultation; authentication service primary hub; wealthiest clientele; Tier 4 waitlist managed from here
- **Brasshollow** — Tier 1–2 tool enhancement focus; precision instruments; engineering-meets-magic specialty items; craftsperson customer base
- **Stonegate** — Tier 1–2 everyday household items plus Tier 2–3 weapons and armor enchantments; martial clientele; dwarven aesthetic preferences
- **Bellharbor** — Tier 1–2 preservation and communication focus; maritime trade clientele; diplomatic accessories; travel-oriented

**Portal convenience premium:**  
Customers who access a shop whose inventory was sourced from another location (goods transferred via portal) do not pay a surcharge — Art of Facts absorbs portal transfer costs as part of its network operating model. The premium is built into base pricing. This is philosophically consistent: Delyra's position is that portal access should not be an invisible tax on customers; it is a production and distribution infrastructure cost.

### Noble and Institutional Patronage

Tier 4 commissions and large institutional contracts operate as patronage relationships, not standard commercial transactions. These are the high-margin, low-volume anchors of Art of Facts' revenue model.

**Typical patron engagement structure:**
- An initial consultation with Delyra personally (in Goldentarn or at the patron's estate)
- A formal commission proposal with scope, timeline, materials, and maintenance expectations
- A deposit (typically 30–50% of total) upon agreement; balance on delivery
- An ongoing maintenance agreement for Tier 4 items (Delyra visits annually; maintenance fee agreed upfront)

**Current notable institutional relationships:**
- **Aurumvale Republic Treasury** — Authentication contracts; anti-counterfeit enchantments on official documents
- **The Pinnacle League** (Rini) — Full arena equipment enchantment and maintenance; the relationship Delyra is most publicly proud of
- **Aetheros Magocracy Academy** — Supply of precision research instruments and training materials; academically prestigious
- **Underhelm Mining Authority** — Tool enhancement contracts for deep mining operations; high volume, steady Tier 2 revenue
- **Port & Pour** (Thorin) — Preservation enchantment supply and annual maintenance contracts; the most commercially significant partner relationship
