# Geography & Trade Routes

**Purpose:** Geographic challenges, trade routes, travel logistics, and physical world constraints

---

## World Scale & Structure

### Planet Size
**Circumference:** ~8,000-10,000 miles (roughly 1/3 to 1/2 Earth size, between Moon and Mars)
**Comparison:** Smaller than Earth (24,900 miles), larger than Moon (6,800 miles)

### Continental Structure
**Two Main Continents:**
- **West Continent:** ~600-1,000 miles across, diverse climates from frozen north to desert south
- **East Continent:** Similar size, great lakes region, varied terrain

**Major Islands:**
- **Virellia (Northern Trade Hub):** Large island between continents, south of arctic circle (Iceland-like position)
- **Umbros (Southern Tropical Chain):** Scattered warm islands along southern rim, closer to equator

**Floating City:**
- **Nimbuspire (Aetheros):** Travels between continents through the sky

### Travel Times

**Land Routes (Caravan):**
- Average speed: ~20-25 miles per day
- City-to-city: **2-4 weeks** typical
- Terrain modifiers: Easy (1.0x), Moderate (0.75x), Difficult (0.5x)

**Coastal Sea Routes (Same Continent):**
- Average speed: ~50-100 miles per day (wind dependent)
- Typical voyage: **10-20 days**

**Trans-Oceanic Voyages:**

## Geographic Philosophy in Nubimancy

The Nubimancy world features **diverse and challenging geography** that significantly impacts business operations:
- **Floating Cities:** Require flight or magical lifts
- **Underground Realms:** Limited surface access, tunnel logistics
- **Desert Crossings:** Extreme climate, preservation challenges
- **Volcanic Regions:** High temperatures, specialized equipment needs
- **Frozen Wastes:** Cold preservation, harsh travel conditions
- **Sea Routes:** Maritime logistics, weather dependencies
- **Continental Divide:** Trans-oceanic trade requires major investment
- **Island Nations:** Strategic chokepoints for trade routes

Geography isn't just scenery—it's a **core business constraint** that drives PTE requirements.
