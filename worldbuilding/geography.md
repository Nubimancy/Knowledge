# Geography & Trade Routes

**Purpose:** Geographic challenges, trade routes, travel logistics, and physical world constraints

---

## Geographic Philosophy in Nubimancy

The Nubimancy world features **diverse and challenging geography** that significantly impacts business operations:
- **Floating Cities:** Require flight or magical lifts
- **Underground Realms:** Limited surface access, tunnel logistics
- **Desert Crossings:** Extreme climate, preservation challenges
- **Volcanic Regions:** High temperatures, specialized equipment needs
- **Frozen Wastes:** Cold preservation, harsh travel conditions
- **Sea Routes:** Maritime logistics, weather dependencies

Geography isn't just sceneryâ€”it's a **core business constraint** that drives PTE requirements.
