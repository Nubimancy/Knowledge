# Heroes of Nubimancy

## The Fivefold Oaths

Before they were legends, they were just five sellswords and spell-slingers trying to make rent on their next inn room. Bound not by blood, but by five oaths—one each, shouted over a campfire, half-drunk and wholly sincere—they became known across the realms as **The Fivefold Oaths**. Some say the name refers to their sacred promises. Others say it's just how many times they swore in a single sentence. Either way, the name stuck... and so did their reputation.

### Backstory

After saving the world, celebrating, and moving into the "what next?" stage of things, the group of adventurers realized that they needed to have help to build the dreams they were building in their minds.

They set out for the city of Nimbuspire to talk to the Aetherborn arcane masters of the floating city. Archmagister Patch Stackwell was selected to help them, and realizing that this project would require new ways of thinking, recruited a cadre of apprentices and journeymen mages to help these new "magicks" come into the world, since solving these problems would require new creations and skills. Those creations could then, maybe, go on to help other realms with their learning.

The "nubimancy" project name came from a speech challenge Rini's tusks gave her trying to say "The Aethernet Assembly" too many times.
