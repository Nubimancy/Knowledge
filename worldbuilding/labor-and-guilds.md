# Labor, Guilds & Employment

## Core Philosophy

Mixed employment models across hero businesses demonstrate BC's flexibility in handling complex labor relationships. Guild structures provide quality assurance, networking, and benefits - creating competitive advantage for hero-associated workers.

---

## Employment Classification by Business

### Caravan Captains (Bran's)
**Classification:** Independent Contractors with long-term service agreements

**Rationale:**
- Own/operate their own wagon teams (asset ownership)
- Take contracts from multiple clients (not exclusive to Bran)
- Responsible for equipment maintenance, guard hiring, route execution
- Bran coordinates logistics, provides premium services

**Payment:**
- Negotiated rate per route (distance, cargo value, danger)
- Performance bonuses (on-time, zero loss, customer satisfaction)
- Premium rates for dangerous/time-sensitive deliveries

**Benefits:**
- Access to Bran's logistics network (guaranteed work)
- Premium insurance through guild collective
- Priority wagon ward services
- Guild membership support/dues assistance

**BC Features:** Vendor management, performance tracking, contract tracking, service agreements, bonus calculations

### Guards (Bran's)
**Classification:** Mixed Model

- **Captain-Employed (Standard Routes):** Captain hires/manages for routine runs
- **Bran-Employed (High-Value Routes):** Bran provides elite guard teams for premium service

**Rationale:**
- Demonstrates BC's multiple employment relationships in single operation
- Standard: Captain controls costs, chooses familiar team
- Premium: Bran guarantees security quality, manages liability

**Payment:**
- Captain-employed: Negotiated by Captain (8-15 gold/day + food)
- Bran-employed: Wage tiers (Recruit 10g/day, Veteran 15g/day, Elite 20g/day)

**BC Features:** Multiple employment types, cost allocation to routes/jobs, payroll processing, vendor payment processing

---

### Skilled Workers (All Businesses)
**Classification:** Direct Employees

Alchemists, Enchanters, Brewers, Healers work exclusively for the business.

**Rationale:**
- Use business-owned facilities, equipment, resources
- Create business IP (recipes, techniques, methods)
- Represent business brand and quality

**Employment Tiers:**
- **Masters (Salaried):** 1,200-2,500 gold/year
- **Journeymen (Salaried):** 400-800 gold/year
- **Apprentices (Reduced Wage + Housing/Food):** 100-200 gold/year + room + board

**BC Features:** Standard HR/payroll, skills tracking, certification levels, wage tiers, apprenticeship compensation

---

### Tavern/Service Staff (Thorin's)
**Classification:** Direct Employees

**Tiers:**
- **Brewmasters (Salaried):** 600-1,000 gold/year
- **Servers (Hourly + Tips):** 6-8 silver/day + tips (variable income tracking)
- **Kitchen Staff (Hourly):** 6-10 silver/day
- **Cleaners/Support (Hourly):** 5-7 silver/day

**BC Features:** Mixed salary/hourly, tips tracking, variable shifts, service industry payroll

### Haven Healers (Rini's)
**Classification:** Mixed Model

- **Core Staff (Employees):** Rini + 3-5 senior healers (800-1,500 gold/year)
- **Visiting Specialists (Contractors):** Called for specific cases (fee per service)

**Rationale:**
- Core handles day-to-day healing
- Specialists provide rare expertise (cost-effective vs. full-time)

**BC Features:** Blended employee/contractor in service delivery, labor allocation, specialist consultation fees

---

## Kingdom Tax System

### Progressive Income Tax (BC VAT Implementation)

**Lower Bracket (< 300 gold/year):** 5%
- Most apprentices, entry-level workers
- BC VAT Setup: "Lower Income" posting group = 5%

**Middle Bracket (300-1,000 gold/year):** 10%
- Journeymen, skilled workers, experienced servers
- BC VAT Setup: "Middle Income" posting group = 10%

**Upper Bracket (1,000-5,000 gold/year):** 15%
- Masters, senior staff, successful Captains
- BC VAT Setup: "Upper Income" posting group = 15%

**Wealthy Bracket (5,000+ gold/year):** 20%
- The Five Heroes, top contractors, merchant princes
- BC VAT Setup: "Wealthy Income" posting group = 20%

### Business Profit Tax
- **Flat Rate:** 10% on net profits
- **Paid To:** Kingdom where business registered (all heroes in Nimbuspire)
- **Quarterly Reporting:** Using BC's VAT Statement

### Cross-Kingdom Tax Complexity
- **Challenge:** Captains work across multiple kingdoms
- **Rule:** Workers owe tax to primary residence, kingdoms may claim partial tax for work in territory
- **Solution:** Nubimancy system auto-calculates tax allocation (killer feature!)

**BC Implementation:**
- Multiple VAT Business Posting Groups per vendor/employee
- Location-based VAT calculation
- VAT Settlement by jurisdiction
- Multi-jurisdiction tax handling

**Fantasy Flavor:** In BC UI, "VAT Registration No." displays as "Kingdom Tax Registration"

### Kingdom Pension Requirement

Businesses with 5+ employees must contribute to worker pension funds:

**Contribution Rate:** 5% of gross wages

- Death benefit transfers to beneficiary

**Administration:** Guild-managed for guild members, business-managed for non-guild employees

### BC Implementation

## Apprenticeship Model

### Traditional Structure

**Cash Wage:** 100-200 gold/year (vs. 400-800 for journeyman)

**In-Kind Compensation:**

- **Board:** Three meals per day
- **Clothing:** Work attire/uniforms
- **Training:** Skills education (the real value)

**Duration:** 3-5 years
- Brewing: 3 years
- Alchemy: 4 years
- Enchanting: 5 years

**Advancement:** Journeyman status upon master certification

### Business Implications

**Asset Requirements:** Must own or lease apprentice housing
- Thorin: Dormitory above tavern (owns building)
- Rini: Haven boarding house (owns building)
- Delyra: Workshop upper floors (owns building)

**Expense Tracking:**
- Apprentice wages (low cash)
- Room costs (rent allocation or depreciation)

- Training time (master's time vs. production)

**BC Features:**

- **Total Compensation Value:** ~250-270 gold/year (vs. 400-800 journeyman)
