# Magic Systems & Availability

## Core Philosophy

**Magic is SCARCE**, especially at higher tiers. This scarcity:
- Creates the charlatan economy (fake "magic protection" because people rarely see real magic)
- Explains why magic can't be a pillar of transportation
- Makes the Nubimancy system revolutionary (democratizes business management without personal magical ability)
- Creates major competitive advantage for heroes' businesses

---

## Magical Population Distribution

Magic is extremely rare - most people will never meet a truly powerful mage in their lifetime.

### Top Tier (0.1% - ~50-80 people worldwide)
**Capabilities:**
- Portal magic (5-10 second hold time max)
- Major divine healing (Rini's level)
- Master-level complex enchantments

**Business Impact:**
NOT viable for infrastructure, only emergency/luxury use

### Mid Tier (1-2% - ~500-1,600 practitioners)
**Capabilities:**
- Preservation magic (Thorin's barrels)
- Protective wards (Bran's wagons)
- Scrying/tracking for high-value cargo
- Master alchemy (complex potion formulation)

**Business Impact:**
Premium services, time-intensive, cannot scale easily

### Lower Tier (5-8% - ~2,500-6,400 practitioners)
**Capabilities:**
- Persistent item enchantments (flameless lanterns, ever-sharp tools)
- Minor protective charms
- Journeyman alchemy (follow proven recipes)

**Business Impact:**
Practical tools improving safety/efficiency, accessible but not common

### Non-Magical (90%+)
No magical ability whatsoever - the vast majority

**Implication:** Heroes' access to magical services is a MAJOR competitive advantage

---

## Spellcasting vs. Alchemy

### Spellcasting (Personal Magic)
- Requires innate magical ability
- Requires personal energy (exhausting, limited daily capacity)
- Cannot be stockpiled or transferred
- **Does not scale** - one mage can only do so much per day

### Alchemy (Crafted Magic)
- Requires rare ingredients + knowledge/skill
- Anyone can USE the resulting potion (no magical ability needed)
- Can be produced in batches and stockpiled
- **Scales better** - limited by ingredient availability, not daily energy

**Parallel to Nubimancy:** Just as Nubimancy democratizes business management (no personal wizard needed), alchemy democratizes magical effects (don't need to BE magical to benefit).

---

## Three Categories of Arcane Magic

Heroes' businesses focus on **productizable magic** - services and goods that can be sold, scaled, and integrated into BC:

### 1. Enchanting
Imbuing objects with lasting magical properties
- **Monetized by:** Delyra (Art of Facts)
- **Also used by:** Thorin & Bran (preservation, wards as services)

### 2. Alchemy
Crafting consumable magical effects from rare ingredients
- **Monetized by:** Weltina (Haven Wildlife Preserve - potion production, ingredient sourcing)

### 3. General Spellcasting
Direct magical effects (combat spells, utility magic, divination)
- **NOT directly monetized** in heroes' ecosystem
- Used by adventurers, guards, professional mages
- Heroes USED this (defeating plague) but don't sell it as service
- **Reason:** Personal magic doesn't scale as business model

---

## Nature/Druidic Magic

**Population:** ~1-3% with nature magic affinity (similar scarcity to arcane)
**Distribution:** Concentrated in remote/wilderness areas
**Philosophy:** Focus on nature preservation, not commerce
**Business Role:** Minor - Haven occasionally works with druids as ingredient suppliers

**Current Scope:** Druids exist, Haven has 2-3 druidic vendor relationships for rare herb cultivation, but NO druidic staff or services offered.

---

## Portal Travel

### Constraints
- **Availability:** Only ~50-80 mages worldwide can open portals
- **Duration:** 5-10 seconds maximum hold time
- **Throughput:** One wagon OR ~10 people per opening
- **Scheduling:** Book weeks in advance, limited slots
- **Locations:** Only between established portal anchors (major cities)

### Cost Structure

Portal costs have two components:

**Annual anchor maintenance: 800 AC/year**
Covers the materials to prepare and stabilize a portal anchor space. Applied as a **Portal Anchor Maintenance Seal** (Tier 3 enchantment) at each anchor point annually. Required at both ends of any permanent or semi-permanent gate. See `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` for details.

**Per-use reagent cost: 200–500 AC per opening**
Materials consumed each time a portal is opened. Varies by distance, cargo weight, and mage tier. For on-demand mage-opened portals, the mage's professional service fee is charged on top of this.

**Combined service fee for on-demand openings: 800–1,500 AC total**
When a top-tier mage opens a portal on request (no permanent infrastructure), clients pay a single contracted fee covering reagents, labor, and expertise. The internal cost breakdown is the mage's to manage; clients see the combined rate.

### Business Impact
- NOT viable for regular logistics (why Bran's caravan network exists)
- Only for emergencies or ultra-high-value cargo where speed outweighs cost
- Luxury service for wealthy individuals and kingdom-level transactions
- Most people have never seen portal magic (seems mythical)

## Enchantment Services

> **Pricing reference:** Specific enchantment costs, lifespans, tiers, and service structures are defined in [`enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md`](./enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md). The information below covers operational context and business model structure only.

### Preservation Enchantments (Thorin's Barrels)

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Journeyman to Master enchanter (tier depends on ale type)
- Time: 1-2 hours per barrel
- Capacity: 4-6 barrels per day per enchanter
- Renewal: Required on a scheduled cycle managed by Caskwardens

**Business Model:**
Thorin's barrel preservation uses tiered enchantments — basic freshness charms for standard dwarven ales, specialist Tier 3 preservation for delicate elven varieties. Enchantment is a major operational cost and a key product differentiator (sealed barrels visibly resist tampering, directly addressing post-plague food-safety anxiety).

### Protective Wards (Bran's Wagons)

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Journeyman to Master enchanter
- Time: 2-4 hours per wagon
- Renewal: Required before expiration

**Protection levels:** Weather damage, pests, minor magical creature attacks, basic scrying countermeasures at higher tiers. See the Cargo Ward (Tier 2) and related entries in `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` for the full product line and pricing.

**Business Model:**
Bran offers wards as a premium add-on service. Bran-employed enchanters handle fleet inspection and renewal; volume batch pricing available for large caravan sets.

### Scrying/Tracking Services

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Mid-tier enchanter with divination specialty
- Fresh connection to target required

**Service types:**
- Initial scrying (location finding): one-time assessment
- Continuous tracking: dedicated mage; daily capacity limited
- Long-duration tracking enchantment: fixed-period item

These are premium, low-volume services negotiated individually based on distance, duration, and urgency. Not covered in the standard enchantment catalogue.

**Limitations:**
- Can be blocked by counter-magic (premium wards)
- Continuous tracking is exhausting — requires a dedicated mage
- Privacy concerns — kingdoms have varying consent laws

**Business Use:**
Bran offers tracking enchantments for high-value cargo as a premium add-on. Supply is limited by available specialist practitioners.

### Communication Scrolls

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Journeyman scribe-mage
- Availability: Limited to major cities with scribe-mage guilds

**Details:**
- Single-use (one message, scrolls consumed)
- Short message only (~100 words max)
- Must be pre-paired; cannot send to an arbitrary destination
- 1-hour delay for message to appear
- Anyone literate can use them (no magical ability required to use, only to create)

**Business Impact:**
Heroes use sparingly for critical coordination (caravan emergencies, urgent order changes). Physical couriers are much cheaper, just slower. For reusable communication options, see the Communication Crystal (Tier 2) in `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md`.

## Persistent Enchanted Items

Common enchanted tools representing the "democratization of magic" — created by apprentice and journeyman enchanters at Art of Facts. For complete pricing, lifespans, tier classifications, and refresh requirements, see [`enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md`](./enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md).

### Flameless Lanterns
Steady warm light without flame risk; adjustable brightness. Popular with mining operations, dangerous environments, and households eliminating fire hazard. Available at Tier 1 (short-cycle, refreshable).

### Ever-Sharp Tools
Maintains edge quality on chisels, blades, and cutting tools — no dulling under normal use. Reduces maintenance costs for craftspeople and smiths. Available at Tier 1 (short-cycle, refreshable).

### Minor Protective Charms
Mild luck effects, minor injury reduction, comfort in dangerous situations. **Charlatan Risk:** Many fake charms circulate in the post-plague market — Delyra's certification seal distinguishes genuine items from frauds.

**Business Model (Art of Facts):**
Delyra employs journeyman enchanters producing these items following proven patterns. Steady household and tradesperson demand. Refresh services (see `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md`) provide recurring revenue alongside initial item sales.

- **5-10 Lower-Tier Apprentices:** Create persistent items (lanterns, tools, charms), assist major workings

### Business Services

**1. Magical Authentication (Fraud Prevention):**
- Verify authenticity of magical items; detect charlatan fakes
- **Free to all customers** — deliberate loss-leader to rebuild post-plague trust in magic
- Every genuine Art of Facts item carries a certification seal; free health checks available at any shop
- Goal: make buyers expect a seal, so unsealed items become visibly suspect

**2. Custom Enchantment Orders:**
- Bespoke enchanted items for specific needs, Tier 1–4
- See `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` for pricing by tier and commission structure
- Timeline: days to months depending on complexity and lunar scheduling

**3. Enchanted Item Retail:**
- Pre-made catalog items (see `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` for full catalogue)
- Margin: 60-80% markup on Tier 1 standardized items (journeyman labor, high volume)

**4. Magical Education/Apprenticeships:**
- Train promising young mages
- Revenue: Apprentices work for reduced wage in exchange for training

**Why This Matters:**
Single business with multiple revenue streams requiring different BC modules — services, projects, manufacturing, retail, HR/training.

## The Charlatan Economy

### Why Scarcity Creates Fraud

Because 90%+ of population has NEVER encountered real high-level magic:
- **Information Asymmetry:** Can't distinguish real from fake
- **Fear & Desperation:** Post-plague anxiety creates demand for "protection"
- **Mythical Reputation:** Heroes used magic to save world - seems all-powerful
- **Rare Verification:** Few have access to legitimate certification

### Common Scams
- "Magic Protection" Charms: Carved symbols, no enchantment (5-20 gold, worthless)
- "Health Tonics": Colored water as healing potions (10-30 gold, sometimes harmful)
- "Blessed" Goods: Regular items with fake backstory (50-200% markup)
- "Curse Removal": Theatrical rituals, no effect (50-200 gold for nothing)

### Heroes' Response
- **Delyra's Certification:** Trusted authority to expose frauds
- **Rini's Haven:** Only legitimate potions with quality guarantees
- **Collective Reputation:** Heroes' fame discourages fraud in supply chains

**Business Impact:**
Demonstrates importance of brand trust, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance in BC.
