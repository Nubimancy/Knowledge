# Magic Systems & Availability

## Core Philosophy

**Magic is SCARCE**, especially at higher tiers. This scarcity:
- Creates the charlatan economy (fake "magic protection" because people rarely see real magic)
- Explains why magic can't be a pillar of transportation
- Makes the Nubimancy system revolutionary (democratizes business management without personal magical ability)
- Creates major competitive advantage for heroes' businesses

---

## Magical Population Distribution

Magic is extremely rare - most people will never meet a truly powerful mage in their lifetime.

### Top Tier (0.1% - ~50-80 people worldwide)
**Capabilities:**
- Portal magic (5-10 second hold time max)
- Major divine healing (Rini's level)
- Master-level complex enchantments

**Business Impact:**
NOT viable for infrastructure, only emergency/luxury use

### Mid Tier (1-2% - ~500-1,600 practitioners)
**Capabilities:**
- Preservation magic (Thorin's barrels)
- Protective wards (Bran's wagons)
- Scrying/tracking for high-value cargo
- Master alchemy (complex potion formulation)

**Business Impact:**
Premium services, time-intensive, cannot scale easily

### Lower Tier (5-8% - ~2,500-6,400 practitioners)
**Capabilities:**
- Persistent item enchantments (flameless lanterns, ever-sharp tools)
- Minor protective charms
- Journeyman alchemy (follow proven recipes)

**Business Impact:**
Practical tools improving safety/efficiency, accessible but not common

### Non-Magical (90%+)
No magical ability whatsoever - the vast majority

**Implication:** Heroes' access to magical services is a MAJOR competitive advantage

---

## Spellcasting vs. Alchemy

### Spellcasting (Personal Magic)
- Requires innate magical ability
- Requires personal energy (exhausting, limited daily capacity)
- Cannot be stockpiled or transferred
- **Does not scale** - one mage can only do so much per day

### Alchemy (Crafted Magic)
- Requires rare ingredients + knowledge/skill
- Anyone can USE the resulting potion (no magical ability needed)
- Can be produced in batches and stockpiled
- **Scales better** - limited by ingredient availability, not daily energy

**Parallel to Nubimancy:** Just as Nubimancy democratizes business management (no personal wizard needed), alchemy democratizes magical effects (don't need to BE magical to benefit).

## Three Categories of Arcane Magic

Heroes' businesses focus on **productizable magic** - services and goods that can be sold, scaled, and integrated into BC:

### 1. Enchanting
Imbuing objects with lasting magical properties
- **Monetized by:** Delyra (Art of Facts)
- **Also used by:** Thorin & Bran (preservation, wards as services)

### 2. Alchemy
Crafting consumable magical effects from rare ingredients
- **Monetized by:** Rini (Haven - potion production, ingredient sourcing)

### 3. General Spellcasting
Direct magical effects (combat spells, utility magic, divination)
- **NOT directly monetized** in heroes' ecosystem
- Used by adventurers, guards, professional mages
- Heroes USED this (defeating plague) but don't sell it as service
- **Reason:** Personal magic doesn't scale as business model

---

## Nature/Druidic Magic

**Population:** ~1-3% with nature magic affinity (similar scarcity to arcane)
**Distribution:** Concentrated in remote/wilderness areas
**Philosophy:** Focus on nature preservation, not commerce
**Business Role:** Minor - Haven occasionally works with druids as ingredient suppliers

**Current Scope:** Druids exist, Haven has 2-3 druidic vendor relationships for rare herb cultivation, but NO druidic staff or services offered.

---

## Portal Travel

### Constraints
- **Availability:** Only ~50-80 mages worldwide can open portals
- **Duration:** 5-10 seconds maximum hold time
- **Throughput:** One wagon OR ~10 people per opening
- **Cost:** 800-1,500 gold per portal opening
- **Scheduling:** Book weeks in advance, limited slots
- **Locations:** Only between established portal anchors (major cities)

### Business Impact
- NOT viable for regular logistics (why Bran's network exists)
- Only for absolute emergencies or ultra-high-value cargo
- Luxury service for wealthy individuals
- Most people have never seen portal magic (seems mythical)

## Enchantment Services

### Preservation Enchantments (Thorin's Barrels)

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Mid-tier practitioner
- Time: 1-2 hours per barrel
- Duration: 6-12 months
- Cost: 50-120 gold per barrel
- Capacity: 4-6 barrels per day per enchanter

**Business Model:**
Thorin employs 1-2 mid-tier enchanters dedicated to barrel preservation. Major operational cost, key differentiator.

### Protective Wards (Bran's Wagons)

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Mid-tier practitioner
- Time: 2-4 hours per wagon
- Duration: 3-6 months
- Renewal: Required before expiration

**Cost Tiers:**
- **Basic (50-80 gold):** Weather resistance, pest deterrent, 3 months
- **Standard (100-150 gold):** Above + structural reinforcement, minor creature deterrent, 4-5 months
- **Premium (200-300 gold):** Above + significant magical protection, tracking prevention, 6 months

**Protection:** Weather damage, pests, minor magical creature attacks, basic scrying (premium tier)

**Business Model:**
Bran offers wards as premium add-on. Employs 1-2 mid-tier enchanters for wagon inspection/renewal.

### Scrying/Tracking Services

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Mid-tier with divination specialty
- Fresh connection to target required

**Pricing:**
- Initial scrying (location finding): 150-250 gold per attempt
- Continuous tracking (24-hour monitoring): 400-600 gold per day
- Long-duration tracking enchantment: 300-500 gold for 1-month

**Limitations:**
- Can be blocked by counter-magic (premium wards)
- Continuous tracking exhausting - requires dedicated mage
- Privacy concerns - kingdoms have varying consent laws

**Business Use:**
Bran offers tracking enchantments for high-value cargo (500+ gold shipments) as premium add-on.

### Communication Scrolls

**Requirements:**
- Skill: Lower mid-tier (journeyman scribe-mage)
- Availability: Limited to major cities with scribe-mage guilds

**Details:**
- Cost: 40-80 gold per matched pair
- Single-use (one message, scrolls consumed)
- Short message only (~100 words max)
- Must be pre-paired (can't send to arbitrary destination)
- 1-hour delay for message to appear

**Who Can Use:** Anyone literate (no magical ability required to use, only to create)

**Business Impact:**
Heroes use sparingly for critical coordination (caravan emergencies, urgent order changes). Physical couriers much cheaper, just slower.

## Persistent Enchanted Items

Common enchanted tools representing "democratization of magic" - created by apprentice/journeyman enchanters:

### Flameless Lanterns
- Cost: 50-80 gold
- Duration: Permanent (fades after 5-10 years heavy use)
- Benefit: No fire risk, no fuel costs, consistent light
- Market: Mining operations, dangerous environments

### Ever-Sharp Tools
- Cost: 30-60 gold (base tool + 20-40 gold enchantment)
- Duration: Permanent, weakens over 3-5 years
- Benefit: Reduced maintenance, consistent quality

### Minor Protective Charms
- Cost: 20-50 gold
- Duration: 6-12 months
- Benefit: Mild luck, minor injury reduction, comfort in danger
- **Charlatan Risk:** MANY fake charms - Delyra's certification matters!

**Business Model (Art of Facts):**
Delyra employs 5-10 lower-tier apprentices creating these items following proven patterns. Higher-margin items with steady demand. Also offers certification to distinguish real from frauds.

## The Charlatan Economy

### Why Scarcity Creates Fraud

Because 90%+ of population has NEVER encountered real high-level magic:
- **Information Asymmetry:** Can't distinguish real from fake
- **Fear & Desperation:** Post-plague anxiety creates demand for "protection"
- **Mythical Reputation:** Heroes used magic to save world - seems all-powerful
- **Rare Verification:** Few have access to legitimate certification

### Common Scams
- "Magic Protection" Charms: Carved symbols, no enchantment (5-20 gold, worthless)
- "Health Tonics": Colored water as healing potions (10-30 gold, sometimes harmful)
- "Blessed" Goods: Regular items with fake backstory (50-200% markup)
- "Curse Removal": Theatrical rituals, no effect (50-200 gold for nothing)

### Heroes' Response
- **Delyra's Certification:** Trusted authority to expose frauds
- **Rini's Haven:** Only legitimate potions with quality guarantees
- **Collective Reputation:** Heroes' fame discourages fraud in supply chains

**Business Impact:**
Demonstrates importance of brand trust, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance in BC.
