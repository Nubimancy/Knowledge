# Measurements & Units

## Measurement Philosophy

**Traditional Kingdoms:** Use historical/archaic units (medieval trade standards)
**Technical/Magical Kingdoms:** Use metric as "new-fangled precision magic" (Aetheros, Gearhame)
**BC Base Units:** Pounds (weight), Gallons (volume), Miles (distance)
**Demonstrates:** BC multi-UoM conversions for cross-kingdom trade

## Distance

**Traditional:**
- League = 3 miles
- Mile = standard
- Furlong = 1/8 mile = 220 yards

**Maritime:**
- Fathom = 6 feet (depth measurement)
- Cable = 720 feet = 120 fathoms

**Technical (Aetheros, Gearhame):**
- Kilometers as "precision measurement" (1 km = 0.621 miles)

**Informal:**
- "Days of travel" = ~20-25 miles (caravan standard)

**BC Implementation:** Miles as base, all others as alternate UoM with conversions

## Weight

**Traditional Trade Standard:**
- **Hundredweight (cwt)** = 100 lbs (cargo standard)
- **Ton** = 20 cwt = 2,000 lbs (long ton, heavy cargo)
- **Quarter** = 28 lbs (1/4 hundredweight)
- **Stone** = 14 lbs (small goods)

**Technical (Aetheros, Gearhame):**
- Kilograms as "precision standard" (1 kg = 2.205 lbs)

**Dwarven (Underhelm, Durnholde):**
- Prefer stone and hundredweight (traditional crafting)

**Typical Cargo Weights:**
- Small shipment: 2-5 cwt (200-500 lbs)
- Medium shipment: 10-20 cwt (1,000-2,000 lbs)
- Large shipment: 50-100 cwt (5,000-10,000 lbs)
- Wagon capacity: 20-30 cwt (2,000-3,000 lbs) standard
- Portal limit: 10 cwt (1,000 lbs) per use

**BC Implementation:** Pounds as base, all others as alternate UoM

## Volume - Liquid

**Traditional Cask Standards (Thorin's ale, wine, oil):**
- **Tun** = 252 gallons (4 hogsheads, rare/massive)
- **Hogshead** = 63 gallons (standard wholesale)
- **Barrel** = 31.5 gallons (half hogshead)
- **Firkin** = 9 gallons (quarter barrel, tavern size)
- **Pin** = 4.5 gallons (half firkin, personal size)

**Technical (Aetheros):**
- Liters as "precise measurement" (1 gallon = 3.785 liters)

**Thorin's Standard:** Hogshead = 63 gallons (~500 pints/mugs)

**BC Implementation:** Gallons as base, cask sizes as alternate UoM

---

## Volume - Dry Goods

**Traditional Dry Measure (grain, herbs, powders):**
- **Quarter (Seam)** = 8 bushels = 64 gallons dry
- **Bushel** = 8 gallons dry (standard grain unit)
- **Peck** = 2 gallons (1/4 bushel)
- **Gallon (dry)** = Base unit

**Agricultural Kingdoms (Solendria, Aurumvale):** Prefer bushels/quarters

**Technical (Aetheros, Gearhame):** Use weight (kilograms) instead of volume

**BC Implementation:** Gallons (dry) as base, bushel/peck as alternate UoM

---

## Cargo Measurement

**Pricing Method:**
- Traditional kingdoms: By weight (hundredweight) for most goods
- Liquid goods: By volume (hogsheads, barrels)
- Bran's shipping: 2 gold per hundredweight per 100 miles

**Volumetric Weight Concept:**
- Exists for bulky/light items (cloth, feathers)
- "Charges as weight equivalent based on wagon space consumed"

**Measurement Tools:**
- Major cities: Certified scales (guild-maintained)
- Caravan pickup: Portable scales (guild-verified accuracy)

## Temperature

**Common/Descriptive:** Freezing, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Scorching

**Preservation Magic Scale (0-100):**
- 0 = Frozen solid
- 25 = Cold preservation (meat, fish)
- 50 = Comfortable/mild
- 75 = Warm (fermentation, brewing)
- 100 = Scorching (forging, industrial)

**Technical (Aetheros):** Celsius for academic precision

**BC Implementation:** Text descriptions with optional numeric values

## Cross-Kingdom Trade Conversions

**Aurumvale Banks/Merchants:** Maintain official conversion tables
**Conversion Disputes:** Aurumvale as neutral arbiter (trade standard authority)
**Cultural Tensions:**
- Dwarves scoff at "imprecise metric"
- Aetheros mages mock "archaic imperial"

**Heroes' Advantage:** Nubimancy system handles all conversions automatically (major selling point!)

## BC Unit of Measure Setup

**Base UoM:**
- Pounds (weight)
- Gallons (volume liquid & dry)
- Miles (distance)

**Alternate UoM - Traditional:**
- Stone, Hundredweight, Ton
- Hogshead, Barrel, Firkin, Pin
- Bushel, Peck
- League, Fathom

**Alternate UoM - Technical:**
- Kilograms, Liters, Kilometers

**All Conversions:** Documented and clean
**Reports:** Can display multiple UoM: "15 hundredweight (1,500 lbs / 680 kg)"
**Item-Specific:** Ale in hogsheads/firkins, grain in bushels, cargo in hundredweight

**Demonstrates BC:** Handling complex real-world multi-UoM scenarios
