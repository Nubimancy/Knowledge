## ðŸ“‹ Distinction: Worldbuilding vs. Demo Data

**Worldbuilding (Established):**
- Rules, patterns, ranges
- "Grain costs 1-3 gold per bushel depending on season/quality"
- "Caravan Captains are independent contractors"
- "Magic is scarce - only 1-2% can do mid-tier enchantments"

**Demo Data (Next Phase):**
- Specific instances following the rules
- "Item #GRN-001: Premium Wheat, 2.5 gold/bushel, stock: 150 bushels"
- "Captain Marcus Ironroad, Contract #CAP-042, 200 gold monthly"
- "Sales Order #SO-1247: Goldentarn â†’ Ashford, delivery 15/9/2247"

## ðŸŽ¯ Status: Worldbuilding Complete for BC Demo

**Core rules established:**
âœ… Magic costs and availability
âœ… Employment/guild structures
âœ… Trade restrictions
âœ… Seasonal patterns (sufficient guidance)
âœ… Currency, calendar, measurements
âœ… Political landscape
âœ… World dangers and hero motivations

**Ready for:** Demo Data team to create specific BC instances following these rules!

**Optional additions:** Technology level, daily life, competition details can be added as needed for narrative flavor, but NOT required for BC demo functionality.
