# Patronage and Auction Culture

**Status:** 🟡 Framework — Core structure established; kingdom-by-kingdom auction house detail can expand in data planning
**Priority:** HIGH — Patronage tiers drive conservation funding (Weltina); auction mechanics drive rare creature/item sales (Weltina); sponsorship drives tournament and broadcast rights sales (Rini)

## Overview

Patronage and auction culture are two distinct but overlapping mechanisms through which wealth moves toward specialized work in Nubimancy. Patronage is an ongoing relationship — a wealthy individual or institution that funds a program in exchange for recognition, access, and the satisfaction of association. Auctions are discrete competitive events where a rare lot changes hands to the highest qualified bidder.

Both mechanisms are central to two of the Fivefold Oaths heroes:

- **Weltina Boons** depends on patronage as her primary revenue stream (~35% of Haven's income) and uses auctions to move ethically harvested rare magical components into the market
- **Rini Glar** uses sponsorship relationships (the commercial sports cousin of patronage) and auction-style processes for tournament broadcast rights

Thorin Caskmantle's limited-edition ale allocations are sometimes perceived as an auction-adjacent system, but are deliberately structured as pre-allocation at fixed prices rather than competitive bidding — a design choice explained further below.

## Patronage Culture

### Historical Origins

Patronage in Nubimancy has aristocratic roots. In the older kingdoms — Underhelm, Durnholde, the ancestor states of Aurumvale — powerful families demonstrated their standing partly through the institutions and artists they sustained. A noble family that funded a master craftsperson's guild hall, or sponsored a mage academy's research wing, was not merely being generous: they were demonstrating that they had resources to spare, that they cared about lasting works, and that the community owed them something of its identity.

After the Twilight Plague, the social logic of patronage shifted. The catastrophic loss of skilled practitioners, conservation-worthy species, and functional institutions created genuine need for rebuilding — and with that need came a new class of patron: the **merchant philanthropist** who funds not out of dynastic prestige but out of calculated belief that healthy institutions produce better commerce. Weltina's Haven is the clearest expression of this new model. Her patron base includes traditional noble families (legacy prestige logic) and merchant houses (economic rebuild logic), and she manages both relationships without apologizing for either motivation.

### Who Becomes a Patron

| Patron Type | Primary Motivation | Typical Giving Scale | Common in Kingdoms |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Noble House** | Dynastic prestige; naming legacy; hereditary conservation rights | 2,000–20,000 AC/year | Aurumvale, Virellia, Underhelm |
| **Merchant Guild / House** | Commercial ecosystem investment; reputation; supply security | 500–5,000 AC/year | Aurumvale, Thalassor, Gearhame |
| **Kingdom Government** | Official conservation mandate; diplomatic alignment; public benefit | 5,000–50,000 AC/year | Aurumvale, Virellia, Sylvaran (discretely) |
| **Wealthy Individual** | Personal connection to the cause; Fivefold Oaths fan relationship; exclusive access | 200–3,000 AC/year | All kingdoms; particularly Nimbuspire academics |
| **Religious / Druidic institution** | Mission alignment (conservation, nature, order) | Variable; often in-kind | Sylvaran, Solendria |
| **Cross-hero referral** | Introduced through another Fivefold Oaths business relationship | Varies; often starts small | Any |

### Social Context of Patronage

Patronage relationships carry social weight in proportion to the visibility of the recognition. Naming a habitat enclosure after a noble house in a public-facing preserve is worth far more socially than a private donation of equivalent size to a lesser institution. What Haven offers — and Rini's Pinnacle League similarly — is naming association with a Fivefold Oaths hero, which has cultural cachet beyond what a conventional charitable institution can provide.

In Aurumvale and Virellia, active patronage of recognized institutions is expected of wealthy families — to not participate is a social signal of either stinginess or disapproval. In Durnholde, patronage of craftsperson guilds is deeply traditional but patronage of conservation is a newer concept; Weltina's relationships in Durnholde are still developing. In Sylvaran, the concept of patronage is uncomfortable — druidic communities prefer reciprocal relationship to one-way funding — but land access agreements fill a similar function.

## Conservation Patronage: Weltina's Haven

### Four Patronage Tiers

Mapped to `71-patronage-tiers.csv`.

| Tier | Name | Annual Commitment | Core Benefits |
|------|------|------------------|---------------|
| **1** | **Steward** | 200–800 AC/year | Named in Haven's annual species report; invitation to one patron-only tour per year; seasonal update letter |
| **2** | **Guardian** | 800–3,000 AC/year | Named in species reports and enclosure signage; two patron tours per year; quarterly research briefing; invitation to Haven's patron events |
| **3** | **Protector** | 3,000–10,000 AC/year | Named enclosure, breeding program, or warden territory sponsorship; four annual tours including behind-the-scenes access; monthly briefing; exclusive annual patron symposium with Weltina attendance |
| **4** | **Benefactor** | 10,000+ AC/year | Named program ownership (e.g., "The [Name] Drake Conservation Initiative"); dedicated account warden; research co-authorship opportunities; direct access to Weltina for impact consultations; invitation to Delyra's authentication partner events |

Kingdom government partnerships operate outside the tier structure — they are custom agreements with defined conservation deliverables, regular impact reporting, and formal recognition in official conservation documentation.

### What Patronage Funds

Patron funds are allocated against specific programs, not into a general pool. Each patron at Tier 2 and above receives a program allocation letter at commitment time specifying what their funding directly supports. Major funding categories:

- **Habitat construction and maintenance**: Physical enclosures, climate systems, space expansion
- **Breeding program operations**: Animal care, veterinary services, genetic diversity management
- **Warden territory operations**: Field station upkeep, warden compensation for specific territories, equipment
- **Educational programming**: Curriculum development, visiting scholar costs, school partnership programs
- **Emergency response capacity**: Reserve funds for poaching response, habitat emergency, creature relocation

At Tier 3+, patrons can specify their preferred allocation domain, and Haven honors this when the domain has genuine funding need. Weltina declines patron requests that would direct funding toward species or programs with low conservation priority — she has turned down two Benefactor-level offers because the patron's preferred species was stable and the funding was not needed there. This refusal has, in both historical cases, resulted in the patron increasing their commitment and deferring to Haven's allocation judgment. The move builds long-term trust at the cost of short-term awkward negotiation.

### Naming Rights

Named programs carry formal recognition that propagates through Haven's documentation, signage, and public communications:

| Program Type | Documentation Standard | Physical Signage | Duration |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Species report dedication | Annual report, species program section header | None | Per year; renewed with commitment |
| Enclosure naming | All documentation for that enclosure | Permanent sign at enclosure | Tied to ongoing Protector+ commitment |
| Conservation program naming | All program communications | Haven's public program board | Active while program funded |
| Planar habitat pocket | All documentation; Delyra's co-credit notation | Anteroom plaque | Permanent once established |

Planar habitat pockets — the rare Delyra-crafted dimensional habitats — carry permanent naming rights as a matter of course. A patron who funds the construction and ongoing maintenance of a fire-plane habitat for an elemental creature is making a generational commitment; the naming right is permanent and hereditary.

### Annual Patron Events

Patron events are Haven's primary relationship-maintenance mechanism and a meaningful revenue event in themselves (higher-tier patrons pay event fees on top of base commitments):

- **Spring Emergence Tour**: Held at the start of migration season; wardens brief patrons on territory updates; creature activity is typically high
- **Breeding Season Preview**: Late spring; patrons see active breeding programs; most emotionally impactful event in Haven's calendar — patron retention after attending a successful birth is very high
- **Annual Patron Symposium**: Late autumn; Weltina presents conservation outcomes; research findings shared; Tier 3+ attendance; Delyra and other heroes often attend as cross-business relationship builders
- **Conjunction Dark Patron Dinner**: Held at each Thorin Conjunction — a shared Fivefold Oaths event at a Legendary-partner tavern where Haven patrons and Port & Pour's top clients overlap; informal but highly valued; Conjunction Dark is on the table

## Combat Sports Patronage: Rini's Pinnacle League

### Sponsorship vs. Patronage

In combat sports, the term **sponsorship** is more common than patronage, and there is a meaningful cultural distinction. A conservation patron is funding a cause; a combat sports sponsor is funding an enterprise in exchange for commercial association. The motivations overlap — prestige, access, identity — but the commercial return expectation is more explicit in sponsorship.

Rini manages both:

| Relationship Type | Funder Motivation | Rini's Obligation | Time Horizon |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Fighter Sponsorship** | Visibility through fighter's career; personal connection to athlete | Fighter wears sponsor insignia; sponsor recognized in bout programs; sponsor receives fighter access | Per-season; renewable |
| **Arena Naming/Branding Partnership** | Commercial visibility to arena audience | Sponsor name incorporated in arena branding; exclusivity within category | Multi-year; significant commitment |
| **Tournament Title Sponsorship** | Association with specific event (e.g., "The [Sponsor] Wavebreaker Championship") | Title credit in all event materials; exclusive category rights; VIP access | Per event or per season |
| **VIP Patron Package** | Exclusive access; The Peak attendance; fighter relationships | Reserved seating; behind-the-scenes; social access to Rini and champions | Annual; non-transferable |
| **Season Patronage** | Full-season association and cross-arena visibility | Named in all season materials; priority access across arena network | Full season |

Rini is selective about which sponsors she accepts. She will not accept sponsorship from:
- Entities whose business model involves unregulated pit fighting or fighter exploitation
- Gambling houses operating outside licensed regulated frameworks (consistent with her policy established in `arena-types-and-combat-traditions.md`)
- Commercial entities whose product or reputation would embarrass the fighters she champions

This selectivity creates a waiting list effect. Sponsorship slots in The Peak championship and the Wavebreaker and Blackwoods arenas are over-subscribed; newer sponsors typically enter through the City Arenas and earn their way toward higher-profile association over time.

### Sponsorship Pricing Reference

*Calibrated to the broadcast rights pricing already established in `arena-types-and-combat-traditions.md`.*

| Sponsorship Type | Annual / Event Cost | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Fighter individual sponsorship** | 50–300 AC/season | Scale with fighter rank; champion-level fighters command premium |
| **City Arena naming partner** | 400–1,200 AC/year | Category exclusivity per arena |
| **Tournament title sponsor (per event)** | 200–800 AC/event | Higher for championship events |
| **The Peak championship title** | 2,000–5,000 AC | Single season; most coveted; approached as negotiated private arrangement |
| **VIP Patron package** | 300–800 AC/year | Limited seats; The Peak hospitality adds 200–400 AC if included |
| **Season patronage (full network)** | 1,500–4,000 AC/year | Rare; only a handful exist across the league |

## Auction Culture

### What Auction Houses Are

Auction houses in Nubimancy are professional intermediary institutions — they organize lots, manage bidder qualification, run the event, and take a commission on the final sale price (typically 8–15% from the seller; 3–5% buyer's premium). They are more prevalent in commercially sophisticated cities and largely absent from isolationist or low-commerce settlements.

**Major auction houses by city:**
- **Goldentarn** (Aurumvale): Finest commercial auction infrastructure in the world; handles high-value item and creature lots; most competitive bidder pools
- **Bellharbor** (Virellia): Diplomatic-adjacent; preferred for politically sensitive lots; discretion is a core service
- **Nimbuspire** (Aetheros): Academic and enchanted item specialty; research partnership lots and rare material auctions
- **Seastrand** (Thalassor): Maritime cargo and perishable goods; Dutch auction format dominates
- **Ashford** (Cindralis): Industrial materials; smelted alloy lots and forge-quality components
- **Stonegate** (Durnholde): Gem and mineral specialty; creature components with underground-origin materials

Auction houses without fixed physical locations also exist: mobile events coordinated through messaging networks that bring qualified bidders to a neutral location for a single high-value lot. These are rare and expensive to organize; typically reserved for items of such value or sensitivity that no standing venue is appropriate.

### Auction Formats

| Format | Description | Common Use Cases | Advantages |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Open Ascending (English)** | Bidders raise price openly; last bidder wins | Standard creature component lots; common commercial goods | Creates visible price discovery; builds excitement; ensures competitive bidding |
| **Sealed Bid** | All bids submitted privately; highest wins | High-value politically sensitive lots; diplomatic items; broadcast rights | Prevents bid intimidation; preferred when bidder identity is sensitive |
| **Dutch (Descending)** | Price starts high, drops until first bidder accepts | Bulk seasonal allocations; fungible goods in quantity | Speed; efficient for lots where exact bidder doesn't matter |
| **Silent** | Written bids on a sheet at a displayed lot; winner at close | Charity conservation fundraisers; smaller lots at patron events | Low-pressure; inclusive; socially comfortable for non-professionals |
| **Reserve + Open** | Minimum price set privately; ascending from reserve if met | Rare creature components; enchanted artifacts | Protects seller from distressed pricing while still competitive |

### Kingdom Culture Variation

| Kingdom | Preferred Format | Cultural Notes |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Aurumvale** | Open ascending; strong auction house culture | Bidding publicly is a class display; winning prestigious lots is a social event worth attending |
| **Virellia** | Sealed bid preference for high-value; open for entertainment | Propriety matters; being seen to want something too eagerly is slightly déclassé |
| **Durnholde** | Reserve + open; formal setting required | Dwarven buyers expect thorough provenance documentation; a poorly documented lot will not attract serious bids regardless of quality |
| **Underhelm** | Invitation-only private sale or guild allocation | Public auctions are rare; Underhelm prefers controlled distribution through known channels |
| **Cindralis** | Open ascending; meritocratic "let the price demonstrate worth" | No social discomfort about aggressive bidding; it is expected |
| **Siroccane** | Negotiated arrangement; formatted auctions feel foreign | Nomadic trade culture prefers direct bargaining over structured formats; Weltina's wyvern territory dealings use relationship pricing rather than auction |
| **Sylvaran** | Not applicable; Sylvaran does not participate in commercial auctions | Druidic culture: exchange relationships rather than competitive bidding |

## Creature Component Auctions (Weltina)

### What Is Auctioned

Ethically harvested creature components enter Haven's auction system at three frequency levels:

| Frequency | Component Type | Examples |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Regular seasonal lots** | Materials from stable/vulnerable species with established harvest schedules | Fire Salamander products; Drake scale seasonal shed; Wyvern wing membrane |
| **Event-triggered lots** | Components available following specific events (natural deaths, rescue cases, breeding surplus) | Components from natural-death dragonics; rescued-creature surplus; breeding program managed yield |
| **Rare exceptional lots** | Materials from endangered species, available in very limited quantities from specific warden-overseen events | Unicorn horn shavings; Phoenix molted feathers; Celestial Stag antler velvet |

Haven does not auction materials from Critically Endangered species as standing commercial product. When exceptional components from such species become available (natural death, or material voluntarily given under a documented partnership agreement), they are handled as individual negotiated lots with highly qualified buyers, not as open-market events.

### Buyer Qualification

Not everyone who wants to buy creature components at Haven's auctions is permitted to do so. Buyer qualification is a deliberate filter:

- **Individual buyers**: Must demonstrate certified use purpose (licensed enchanter, registered alchemist, qualified researcher, or documented institutional purchaser)
- **Institutional buyers**: Must hold standing relationship with Haven or provide Warden Guild endorsement
- **Delyra priority**: By partnership agreement, Delyra's Art of Facts holds first-refusal on up to 60–70% of Haven's total component output — this is a standing commercial contract, not an auction. The auction system handles the remaining supply.
- **Animal-welfare screening for live creature lots**: Any bidder on live creature placements must demonstrate facility adequacy (inspected by Haven or by a certified warden on Haven's behalf) and sign a post-sale welfare access agreement

### Creature Placement Auctions

Surplus animals from breeding programs — typically second- or third-generation from critically endangered species whose populations are recovering — may become available for placement at qualified facilities when Haven's space is constrained or when a bidder can demonstrably provide superior habitat conditions.

- **Format**: Sealed bid with Haven reviewing both price and placement quality score (a Haven-defined weighted assessment of facility, expertise, and welfare commitment)
- **Haven retains inspection rights**: Post-sale welfare visits at 90 days, 1 year, and then annually; failure to meet welfare standards triggers a right-of-return clause
- **Pricing norms by species rarity**:

| Conservation Status | Placement Lot Approach | Typical Price Range |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Stable/Abundant species | Open ascending; price-driven | 20–200 AC per animal |
| Vulnerable species | Reserve + open; minimum welfare score required to bid | 200–1,000 AC per animal |
| Endangered species | Sealed bid; high welfare threshold; Weltina personal review | 1,000–10,000+ AC per animal |
| Critically Endangered | Not auctioned; negotiated private placement only | Individually determined |

### Post-Sale Welfare Oversight

Weltina considers the welfare obligation permanent for any creature Haven places. The post-sale inspection right is not a legal mechanism she expects to exercise frequently — she expects the qualification process to screen appropriately — but its existence changes buyer behavior. Buyers who know Weltina's wardens may show up annually are buyers who maintain their facilities.

One live placement auction has been formally revoked in Haven's history. The buyer passed initial qualification but their facility was found to be inadequate at the 90-day inspection. The creature was returned; the buyer was blacklisted; the incident was reported to the Warden Guild. Weltina does not discuss this case publicly, but it is known in the conservation community.

## Tournament Broadcast Rights Auctions (Rini)

### Packaging Broadcast Rights

Broadcast rights for Pinnacle League events are sold as packages rather than per-event. A rights-holder purchases the right to broadcast from a defined set of events within a defined geographic scope for a defined period. The two main dimensions are:

- **Format tier**: Audio relay only, or visual scrying broadcast (the premium tier requiring Tier 3 enchantment infrastructure — see `arena-types-and-combat-traditions.md`)
- **Geographic scope**: City-only, regional (multi-city), multi-kingdom, or full-realm

### Rights Auction Process

Broadcast rights are sold via sealed-bid auction at the start of each season. Rini manages the auction directly rather than through a third-party auction house — she prefers to review bidder identity and ensure no conflict with her gambling house policy.

**Sealed bid rationale**: The bidder pool for visual broadcast rights is small enough (20–40 qualified buyers realm-wide, primarily gambling establishments and noble house entertainment) that an open ascending auction would create social leverage problems. Sealed bid keeps competitors' valuations private.

**Rights period**: Annual for standalone arena rights; two-year maximum for full multi-realm packages (longer terms are available by direct negotiation, not auction).

### Broadcast Rights Pricing Reference

*From `arena-types-and-combat-traditions.md`.*

| Scope | Audio Only | Audio + Visual |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Single city | 80–120 AC/season | 200–300 AC/season |
| Regional (3–5 cities) | 120–200 AC/season | 300–500 AC/season |
| Multi-kingdom | Negotiated; 200–400 AC/season | Negotiated; 500–1,200 AC/season |
| Full realm (The Peak championship package) | 250–500 AC/season | 800–2,000 AC/season |

The Peak championship rights are the premium lot. They are not sold through the regular sealed-bid season auction — they are negotiated privately with a small set of pre-qualified institutions in the weeks before the season opens. Rini treats this as a relationship transaction rather than a price-maximization event.

### Relationship with Gambling Houses

Gambling house buyers are the primary commercial customer for visual broadcast rights. They invest in Tier 3 Visual Broadcast Receiver Panel infrastructure (300–600 AC installation per `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md`) because live visuals are essential to their wagering product — audio narration alone does not generate the same active-betting engagement.

Rini's position on gambling is documented in `arena-types-and-combat-traditions.md`: she works with licensed, regulated establishments only and maintains ambivalence about the industry. In the broadcast rights context, this translates to:

- Unlicensed or underground gambling operations are disqualified from bidding
- A licensed house that subsequently violates kingdom gambling regulations loses rights at next renewal with no refund
- Rini reserves the right to suspend rights for a licensed house whose operations become publicly embarrassing to the Pinnacle League — this has never been invoked but the clause exists in every rights agreement

---

## Thorin and the Non-Auction

Thorin Caskmantle's Conjunction Dark and other limited editions are worth mentioning here because they are frequently *perceived* as an auction-adjacent system — rare goods, high demand, competitive desire among buyers — but are deliberately structured otherwise.

Port & Pour's policy: all limited edition pre-allocations are sold at confirmed fixed prices. Legendary partner taverns receive their allocation notice before any batch is brewed; prices are fixed at the season's announcement. There is no bid, no competition, no price discovery event. This is a deliberate cultural and commercial choice: Thorin views competitive bidding for ale as incompatible with the tavern culture he is building. A Legendary tavern's relationship with Port & Pour is a trust relationship, not a transaction. The Conjunction Dark sitting on a Legendary tavern's shelf is there because Port & Pour trusts that tavern to serve it with the context it deserves, not because they outbid someone.

The only case where a Conjunction Dark barrel might appear at auction is if a Legendary-tier tavern collapses, changes ownership, or defaults on its allocation agreement — in which case Port & Pour reclaims the allocation and may release it to the market. This has happened twice. Both releases were handled through Bellharbor's auction house as sealed-bid lots, and both generated considerable competitive interest.
