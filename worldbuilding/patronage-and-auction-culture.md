## Overview

This document defines the cultural and commercial practices surrounding patronage (ongoing funding relationships) and auctions (one-time competitive acquisition events) in Nubimancy. Both Weltina Greensong and Rini Stormcaller rely on these mechanisms heavily: Weltina for conservation program funding and rare creature auctions, and Rini for tournament sponsorship and broadcast rights sales. Understanding the cultural norms and economic structure of patronage and auctions is essential for generating realistic demo data.
