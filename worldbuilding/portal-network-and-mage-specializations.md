# Portal Network and Mage Specializations

**Status:** 🔴 Placeholder — Cross-cutting dependency for Bran, Delyra, and Rini hero companies
**Priority:** CRITICAL — Portal services are referenced in route planning, enchantment delivery, shop locations, and tournament travel
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24

## Overview

This document defines the portal network infrastructure, how portals are established and maintained, the specializations of portal mages, and the commercial service ecosystem built around portal travel. Portals are a key logistics primitive used across multiple hero businesses: Bran uses them for caravan and route planning, Delyra depends on them for shop locations and material sourcing, and Rini's tournament infrastructure relies on portal travel for fighters and spectators.

## Portal Network Infrastructure

### Portal Types
- **[To be completed]** — Fixed Permanent Portals (major city hubs, high capacity, always active)
- **[To be completed]** — Semi-Permanent Portals (established trade route links, require periodic maintenance)
- **[To be completed]** — Temporary Portals (event-specific, expensive, mage-intensive)
- **[To be completed]** — Emergency Portals (crisis use, very expensive, short duration)

### Gateway Locations
- **[To be completed]** — Which of the 20 cities have permanent portal hubs
- **[To be completed]** — Hub capacity limits (transfers per hour)
- **[To be completed]** — Gateway pairing map (which gateways connect to which)
- **[To be completed]** — Dimensional hub locations (accessible only via portal, used by Delyra)

### Network Governance
- **[To be completed]** — Who controls the portal network (guild, kingdom, private operator mix)
- **[To be completed]** — Access rights and licensing requirements
- **[To be completed]** — Emergency priority protocols (who gets priority during crises)
