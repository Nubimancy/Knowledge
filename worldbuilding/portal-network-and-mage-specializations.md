# Portal Network and Mage Specializations

**Status:** 🟡 Framework — Core rules established; city-level hub detail and service pricing calibrated
**Priority:** CRITICAL — Portal services are referenced in route planning, enchantment delivery, shop locations, and tournament travel
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

## Overview

A portal gate is a fixed doorway between two material-plane locations — a mage-constructed aperture that allows near-instant transit across distances that would otherwise require weeks of travel. Portal gates are not pocket dimensions and do not require the rare dimensional crafting ability. A sufficiently skilled mage can construct one; the question is cost, political will, and maintenance.

The result is a two-tier logistics world: **portal cities**, which enjoy instant cross-realm connectivity at premium prices, and **caravan cities**, which depend on overland routes and the professionals who know them. Bran Brightwood's Caravans of Fortune thrives partly because ten of the world's twenty major cities have no portal hub at all.

## Portal Gate Mechanics

### What a Portal Gate Is

A portal gate consists of two **anchor points** — one at each end of the connection — tuned to resonate with each other. When activated, the aperture between them opens and transit occurs. Key physical rules:

- **Single connection**: Each gate is tuned to a specific counterpart. A gate in Goldentarn that connects to Bellharbor cannot be re-tuned to Seastrand — a new gate must be constructed.
- **Bidirectional by default**: Transit can flow both ways simultaneously, though most gates are operated with scheduled one-way priority windows to manage flow.
- **Size limits**: A standard gate handles roughly a loaded merchant cart — approximately 500–700 kg and 2m × 2m cross-section. Oversized cargo requires specialist construction from the outset; retrofitting an undersized gate is not possible.
- **Time**: Transit is instantaneous from the traveler's perspective. No time passes in transit.
- **Maintenance**: Annual re-enchantment is required to keep gates active. See Portal Anchor Maintenance Seals in `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` (Tier 3, 800 AC/year per anchor pair).

### Construction

Building a portal gate requires a **Portal Architect** — a mage with specialized training in planar topology and anchor-binding technique. This is not the rare-beyond-rare capacity needed for pocket dimensions; Portal Architects number in the dozens across the known world rather than three to six per generation. It is, however, skilled and expensive work:

- Construction of a new paired gate: **6,000–15,000 AC** depending on distance, terrain complexity, and required capacity
- Construction timeline: **3–8 weeks** on-site at both ends simultaneously (typically two mage teams coordinating)
- The farther the gate pair, the more energy required for initial calibration; cross-continental gate construction costs considerably more than within-kingdom connections

Portal Architects are typically trained through Nimbuspire's arcane institutions or the Aetheros-affiliated Portal Mages' Compact. Aetheros does not own the gates they help design, but their training pipeline means most Portal Architects have professional ties to Nimbuspire.

### Distinction from Pocket Dimensions

Portal gates and pocket dimensions share no mechanics and should not be confused. See `dimensional-pocket-mechanics.md` for the full comparison. The short version: portal gates are infrastructure anyone can maintain; building new ones is skilled work for dozens of practitioners; pocket dimensions require one of three to six living individuals in the world and cannot be maintained by anyone other than their creator.

Delyra's five shops (Nimbuspire, Goldentarn, Brasshollow, Stonegate, Bellharbor) are connected by portal gates — real buildings, standard portal infrastructure, maintained annually. The Fold is separate, personal, and irreplaceable.

## The Portal Network: City Hub Map

### Ownership Model

There is no single portal network authority. Each gateway hub is owned and operated by the kingdom or city-state where it sits. Portal Architects are hired by kingdoms to build gates; the resulting infrastructure belongs to the commissioning power and is operated under their sovereignty.

This creates a politically fragmented but commercially vibrant network. Kingdoms can restrict access, set transit fees, maintain customs inspection at their end, or suspend service entirely for political purposes. During the Twilight Plague, three kingdoms closed their portal hubs within days of outbreak reports — this was controversial but legally unambiguous. Bran Brightwood's post-plague business case rests significantly on the fact that caravan routes cannot be closed by a single political decision.

Aetheros (Nimbuspire) is the most technically sophisticated portal operator in the world, maintains the largest hub, and provides cross-continental relay capacity that no other city can match due to the floating city's positional freedom. They are a major player but not a controller.

### Major Portal Hubs (Permanent, High-Capacity)

| City | Kingdom | Hub Notes | Primary Traffic |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Nimbuspire** | Aetheros | The largest hub; floating city connects both continents; capable of cross-continental relay; highest capacity | Research transit, diplomatic travel, enchanted goods, academic exchange |
| **Goldentarn** | Aurumvale | Premier commercial hub; handles highest non-Nimbuspire cargo volume; banking access drives traffic | Merchant cargo, currency transfers, high-value goods |
| **Bellharbor** | Virellia | Diplomatically neutral island location; preferred for cross-kingdom personnel transit | Diplomatic missions, tournament fighters, luxury goods, tourism |
| **Seastrand** | Thalassor | Maritime complement; portal handles time-sensitive cargo when sea route timing is wrong | Perishable seafood, pearls, exotic spices; incoming raw materials |
| **Akran** | Siroccane | Desert hub; without it the western desert cities would be almost unreachable quickly | Spices, silk, glass; urgent water and supply shipments in |
| **Stonegate** | Durnholde | Mountain hub; high transit costs but necessary winter lifeline; Durnholde uses portal revenue as a strategic asset | Weapons, stonework, forged goods; grain and timber inbound |

### Secondary Portal Hubs (Established Trade Routes, Lower Capacity)

| City | Kingdom | Hub Notes |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Ashford** | Cindralis | Industrial-focus hub; smelted alloys and obsidian glass outbound; operates on cargo-priority windows |
| **Helm's Call** | Underhelm | Underground hub; the most technically complex permanent installation; required for the gem and mineral trade |
| **Skyreach** | Altavere | Scholarly and crafted goods hub; smaller capacity; primarily used for scroll transit and research supply |
| **Starhollow** | Astravelle | Research-access portal; low traffic volume; maintained primarily for Aetheros academic exchange |

### Cities Without Portal Access (Caravan-Dependent)

| City | Kingdom | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Verdelune** | Sylvaran | Druidic culture actively resists portal infrastructure on nature grounds |
| **Brasshollow** | Gearhame | Low-magic technology philosophy; Gearhame views portal dependency as an unacceptable strategic weakness |
| **Frostmere** | Nivara | Deliberate isolationism; no portal is a feature, not a bug |
| **Glimmerdeep** | Lumineth | Secretive culture; controlled access to the city is considered a security asset |
| **Thornmere** | Bramblewyn | Commercial volume doesn't justify construction cost; swamp terrain complicates anchor placement |
| **Duskwatch** | Umbros | Umbros actively does not want a trackable transit record of who enters and leaves the city |
| **Ironmere** | Varnok | Guild-run city; guilds maintain formal opposition to portal dependency on economic sovereignty grounds |
| **Sunveil** | Solendria | Agricultural economy; transit volume is agricultural goods (too heavy/low-value for portal economics) |
| **Cragspire** | Drakthar | Martial honor culture; portal travel is seen as bypassing the legitimate difficulty of the journey |
| **Mirefen** | Fenroth | Too small and commercially underdeveloped; no partner city has made investment interest plausible |

## Portal Mage Specializations

Portal gates require skilled practitioners at multiple stages: construction, operations, and specialized applications. These are Guild-certified professions with distinct training pathways, not merely tiers of the same skill.

### Portal Architects

The construction specialists. They design and build new gate pairs, traveling between the two anchor sites to calibrate resonance. Portal Architects are typically contracted for one-time projects; they do not operate ongoing transit services.

- **Certification body**: Aetheros Portal Mages' Compact (most common) or kingdom-sponsored programs
- **Typical engagement**: 3–8 week construction contract, paid flat fee per gate pair
- **Compensation**: 3,000–8,000 AC per gate project (split with partner mage at the other anchor site)
- **Career arc**: Most transition from Transit Operator experience; relatively few pursue architecture as a primary career

### Transit Operators

The daily-operations mages. They sit at a hub and manage gate sessions — activating the aperture, controlling flow, and closing sessions properly. Transit Operators are the most numerous class of portal mage; every operating hub requires at least two on rotation.

- **Certification**: Portal Mages' Compact Standard Operator certification + kingdom-level endorsement per hub
- **Apprentice Transit Operator**: Supervised sessions; handles standard cargo and persons
- **Journeyman Transit Operator**: Unsupervised; handles full cargo weights; licensed for multi-session days
- **Master Transit Operator**: Can certify apprentices; authorized for emergency activations; typically runs hub management
- **Annual compensation**: Apprentice 300–500 AC/year; Journeyman 600–1,000 AC/year; Master 1,400–2,200 AC/year

### Creature-Capable Transit Mages

The specialist tier. Standard portal transit is tuned for inert matter and humanoid biology. Living creatures of unusual size, magical nature, or instinctive planar sensitivity (like elemental creatures, exotic magical beasts, or creatures with inherent dimensional awareness) present distinct transit challenges — they can disrupt aperture stability, resist transit shock, or arrive in unsafe states if handled by standard operators.

Creature-Capable certification requires additional years of training focused on biological transit mechanics. There is no prohibition on creature transit — the limitation is simply finding a mage qualified to do it safely.

- **Rarity**: Perhaps fifteen to twenty fully certified Creature-Capable mages in the known world; another thirty or forty with partial certification covering specific species categories
- **Cost premium**: 3–6× base person transit fee per creature; specialist mage engagement fee additional
- **Weltina's usage**: Rare inter-preserve creature transfers use Creature-Capable mages; most routine warden creature movement uses caravan for cost and welfare reasons
- **Species difficulty tiers**:

| Tier | Examples | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Standard** | Most domesticated magical animals, small familiars | Handled by Journeyman+ Transit Operators |
| **Moderate** | Large non-magical beasts, low-magic creature species | Creature-Capable certification required |
| **Difficult** | Elemental creatures, creatures with inherent portal-sensitivity | Full specialist engagement; specific pre-transit sedation protocols |
| **Exceptional** | Mature apex magical predators, creatures with dimensional attachment | Effectively impractical; caravan or specialist dimensional solution |

### Charter and Event Mages

Temporary gate construction and high-demand event portal management. Distinctly different from operating permanent gates — charter work involves creating temporary gate pairs for specific dates and locations, running at high capacity for a defined event window, and then properly collapsing the anchor safely.

- **Rini's usage**: The Peak championship uses a chartered gate pair constructed seasonally at the mountain venue; Rini contracts a team of Charter Mages each season to build and operate The Peak access portal during the event window
- **Cost**: 1,500–4,000 AC for a full charter gate pair, depending on scale and duration; operators charged per session on top
- **Typical duration**: Event charters operate for 1–4 weeks before being taken down

## Commercial Service Market

### Service Tiers

| Service Type | Description | Advance Booking | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Standard Scheduled** | Slots on the regular transit window (typically 2–4 sessions per day per hub pair); shared with other travelers and cargo | 3–14 days | Regular merchants, routine cargo, scheduled travel |
| **Priority Reserved** | Guaranteed slot at a specific time; bumps standard if capacity is tight | 1–7 days | Time-sensitive cargo, professional travelers, guild contracts |
| **Charter Block** | Full portal capacity reserved for a defined period | 2–8 weeks | Major cargo consignments, tournament transit, diplomatic missions |
| **Emergency Activation** | Out-of-schedule emergency opening; requires Master Transit Operator approval + hub authority sign-off | Same day | Crisis response, critical medical, extreme perishable cargo |

### Pricing Reference

*These are approximate Aurumvale Crown (AC) benchmarks; actual hub-to-hub prices vary by distance, kingdom tariff, and season.*

| Item | Standard | Priority | Charter |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Per person (short route, within-continent)** | 8–15 AC | 15–25 AC | — |
| **Per person (long route, cross-continent relay)** | 20–40 AC | 35–60 AC | — |
| **Cargo (per 100 kg, short)** | 5–10 AC | 10–18 AC | — |
| **Cargo (per 100 kg, long via relay)** | 12–25 AC | 20–40 AC | — |
| **Charter block (per day, standard gate)** | — | — | 80–200 AC |
| **Creature transit (per animal, moderate tier)** | — | 40–100 AC + specialist fee | — |
| **Emergency activation fee (flat)** | — | — | 150–400 AC |

*For context: a skilled craftsperson earns ~1.2 AC/day. A short portal trip per person costs roughly a week's skilled labor income. This is genuinely expensive for common people.*

### Bran's Caravan Advantage

Bran's route planning communicates explicit tradeoffs against portal service:

| Factor | Portal | Bran's Caravan |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Speed** | Instant | 2–4 weeks |
| **Cost** | Very high (per-person, per-kg) | Moderate (bulk economy) |
| **City reach** | 10 of 20 cities only | All 20 cities |
| **Minimum cargo** | Small consignments viable | Better economics at bulk volumes |
| **Living creatures** | Specialist mage required (expensive, limited availability) | Route-standard with Weltina warden partnership |
| **Availability** | Schedule-dependent; can be closed by political decision | Flexible routing; not closable by a single authority |
| **Cultural sensitivity** | Portal customs inspection; no negotiation | Bran's bardic training navigates cultural commerce personally |

Bran offers **portal-integrated routing** for time-critical consignments: caravan to nearest hub, portal transit over the long leg, caravan to final non-portal delivery. This hybrid is typically 40–60% cheaper than full portal-to-portal routing and extends reach to non-hub destinations.

---

## Planar Access: Material Sourcing Portals

A minority of portal mages hold **Planar Access certification** — allowing them to open apertures not to another material-plane city,  but to the boundary zones of adjacent planes (fire, ice, shadow, verdance, storm, and the liminal spaces between them). This is where Delyra sources Boundary Silk, Void Crystal flakes, Resonance Dust, and other dimensional materials.

Planar access transit is inherently more dangerous than material-plane portal operation:

- **Limited aperture stability**: Planar boundary zones are not as stable as material-plane anchor pairs; session windows are shorter and less predictable
- **Hostile environment**: Many planar zones are immediately dangerous to unprepared travelers; Delyra's sourcing trips require personal warding
- **Material plane return timing**: The window for return transit must be pre-calculated; missing it means waiting for the next stable window (hours to days)

Commercially, Planar Access mages charge substantially more for sourcing expedition support:

- Base escort fee for a sourcing expedition: 200–600 AC per session depending on plane and depth
- Exotic planes (storm layer, deep shadow) command higher premiums
- Bran occasionally uses Planar Access services for rare cross-realm cargo legs — specific enchanted materials that cannot safely travel by caravan

## Portal Failure and Political Risk

### Technical Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Consequence |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Seal expiration** | Annual Maintenance Seal not renewed on time | Gate becomes inactive; no transit possible until re-enchanted; standard grace period: 2–4 weeks of degraded partial function before full closure |
| **Anchor damage** | Physical damage to one anchor site | Gate collapses; both sides non-functional; a mis-collapsed gate leaves residual planar distortion at the anchor site for 1–4 weeks |
| **Magical interference** | Ley line shift, major magical event, extreme weather in magically sensitive terrain | Aperture instability; transit suspended by hub authority until disruption clears; rare but documented |
| **Transit interruption** | Someone or something disrupting an open session | Mitigated by Transit Operator procedure; properly collapsed sessions are safe; forcible interruption risks ejecting cargo at unpredictable path-points |

### Political Closure

The most significant "failure mode" for portal-dependent businesses is not technical — it is political. Kingdoms can suspend portal access with no notice and full legal authority. Historical examples:

- **Twilight Plague quarantine closures**: Three kingdoms suspended portals within 48 hours of early plague reports; two of the three closures later proved to have had no confirmed plague presence at the portal hub
- **Contested territory access control**: Kingdoms have used portal closure as a diplomatic pressure tactic during territorial disputes; traders caught in transit at the time face cargo stranding

Bran's service explicitly markets route continuity under political disruption as a value proposition. Caravan routes require diplomatic negotiation to close — they cannot be suspended unilaterally at a control point the way a portal hub can.

### Contingency

For every portal-dependent leg in Caravans of Fortune's hybrid routing, Bran maintains a fallback caravan schedule. If a portal closes unexpectedly, the system routes to the nearest caravan pickup point within 24 hours for standard cargo. High-value or time-critical cargo on portal legs carries a disruption premium that covers the cost of emergency caravan rerouting.
