## Overview

This document defines the technology and magical practices surrounding scroll production, preservation, and the scrying-based intelligence systems used in route planning. Bran Ashwood's businesses depend on scroll processing as a commercial service and on magical data gathering (climate scrying, route hazard reporting) as a navigation tool. This document complements `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` by focusing specifically on scroll-related preservation and arcane data applications.

## Scroll Technology

### What Scrolls Are (In Nubimancy Context)
- **[To be completed]** — Are scrolls primarily communication artifacts, information records, magical spells, or all three?
- **[To be completed]** — Common scroll types by purpose (trade contracts, magical instructions, navigational charts, historical records)
- **[To be completed]** — Physical materials (what "paper" is made of in a magical world — vellum, treated bark, pressed crystal fiber?)

### Scroll Production
- **[To be completed]** — Who produces scrolls (scribes, mage-scribes, specialized guild?)
- **[To be completed]** — Production time and cost norms by scroll complexity
- **[To be completed]** — Bran's value-add in scroll processing vs. raw scroll production

### Scroll Senders and Sources
- **[To be completed]** — What types of entities send scrolls through Bran's processing service
- **[To be completed]** — Volume norms by sender type (merchant guild, kingdom authority, private wizard)
- **[To be completed]** — Inbound scroll formats and intake process

## Preservation Requirements for Scrolls

### Why Scrolls Degrade
- **[To be completed]** — Environmental degradation factors (humidity, temperature, magical interference)
- **[To be completed]** — Information decay vs. physical decay (can a scroll become magically corrupted before physically damaged?)
- **[To be completed]** — Typical unpreserved lifespan by scroll type

### Preservation Enchantment Applications
- **[To be completed]** — Which enchantment types from `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` apply to scroll preservation
- **[To be completed]** — Renewal thresholds and critical thresholds for scroll preservation (maps to `34-preservation-requirements.csv`)
- **[To be completed]** — Climate zone compatibility — which zones require special preservation handling

### Climate Zone Interactions
- **[To be completed]** — Scroll preservation challenges by climate type (desert heat, arctic cold, coastal humidity, magical zones)
- **[To be completed]** — How Bran routes scrolls differently based on destination climate
- **[To be completed]** — Storage requirements at transit waypoints

## Scrying Technology and Intelligence Gathering

### What Scrying Provides
- **[To be completed]** — Types of intelligence gathered via scrying (weather, route hazards, creature migration, caravan positions)
- **[To be completed]** — Scrying accuracy and reliability norms
- **[To be completed]** — Refresh frequency — how often scrying data is updated

### Scrying Service Providers
- **[To be completed]** — Who operates scrying networks (guild, private operators, kingdom services)
- **[To be completed]** — Commercial scrying service tiers (basic, enhanced, real-time)
- **[To be completed]** — Accuracy percentage norms by provider tier (maps to `33-scrying-service-providers.csv`)

### Scrying as Route Planning Input
- **[To be completed]** — How Bran's route planning integrates scrying intelligence
- **[To be completed]** — Scrying-derived risk ratings for route segments

- **[To be completed]** — Tracking and chain-of-custody requirements for sensitive scrolls

### Communication Protocol Context
- **[To be completed]** — How arcane scroll communication fits alongside aethernet and other communication methods (maps to `23-communication-protocols.csv`)
- **[To be completed]** — When scrolls are preferred over aethernet (legal documentation, classified content, magical binding)
- **[To be completed]** — Cross-kingdom communication norms (diplomatic scrolls, trade agreements)

## Caravan and Scroll Coordination

### Festival Caravan Scroll Logistics
- **[To be completed]** — How BranCaravanFestivalCoordination uses scrolls for event communication
