# Preservation Magic and Scroll Technology

**Status:** 🟡 Framework — Required for Bran hero company demo data
**Priority:** HIGH — Scroll preservation and scrying-assisted routing are foundational to BranArcaneScrollProcessing and BranMysticalRoutePlanning
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-24

---

## Overview

This document defines the technology and magical practices surrounding scroll production, preservation, and the scrying-based intelligence systems used in route planning. Bran Ashwood's businesses depend on scroll processing as a commercial service and on magical data gathering (climate scrying, route hazard reporting) as a navigation tool. This document complements `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md` by focusing specifically on scroll-related preservation and arcane data applications.

Scroll technology underpins approximately 10% of Bran's direct revenue through intelligence and consulting services, and is operationally critical across all twelve caravan squads. The scroll mail network also enables Bran's kingdom postal contracts and diplomatic pouch handling — a relationship-intensive business that reinforces his political access across the continent.

## Scroll Technology

### What Scrolls Are

In Nubimancy, scrolls are **multi-purpose physical documents** that serve simultaneously as communication artifacts, legal instruments, information records, and — in some specialist cases — stored magical effects. The physical format is deeply trusted and has been standard for centuries because scrolls cannot be remotely intercepted or altered after sealing in the way that aethernet transmissions technically can be. A sealed scroll is also inherently bounded: it exists in one place, can be witnessed, and can carry a binding enchantment that triggers with the reader's contact.

**Common scroll types by purpose:**

| Type | Description | Typical Sender |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Trade Contract** | Binding commercial agreement with authentication seal; legally enforceable | Merchant guilds, trading companies |
| **Diplomatic Pouch Scroll** | Kingdom-to-kingdom official communication; often sealed with kingdom enchantment | Kingdoms, noble houses |
| **Navigational Chart Update** | Route segment intelligence, seasonal hazard notes, waypoint condition reports | Scrying networks, caravan captains |
| **Intelligence Briefing** | Threat assessment, migration pattern summary, market entry intelligence | Caravans of Fortune consulting service |
| **Magical Instruction** | Spell notation, enchantment formulae, or crafting schematics requiring precise reproduction | Enchanters' Guild, Art of Facts |
| **Historical Record** | Archive-grade documentation; government census, guild membership registry, legal precedent | Kingdom authorities, institutions |
| **Personal Correspondence** | Letters, family communication, private business notes | Individual private senders |

**Physical materials:**  
Standard scrolls are made from **treated vellum** — animal hide processed by guild tanners with a lime wash and drying tension that produces a thin, durable writing surface. Higher-quality archival scrolls use **crystal fiber parchment**, a rare material produced from pressed and dried strands of low-grade resonance crystal. Crystal fiber parchment holds enchantments better, resists physical decay substantially, and is prohibitively expensive for routine mail (roughly 15× the cost of treated vellum). Bran's scroll processing handles both but routes them through entirely separate handling chains.

Common trade-route scrolls use **bark-derived paper** as the lowest cost option — produced from Sylvaran-sourced tree bark processed in Aurumvale mills. Bark paper is adequate for short-transit, routine correspondence but degrades faster under climate extremes and holds preservation enchantments poorly.

---

### Scroll Production

Scrolls are produced by **Guild Scribes** — members of the Transcribers' and Cartographers' Fellowship, the continent's primary guild for written documents, official records, and navigation charts. The Fellowship operates in all major cities and most secondary hubs. Apprentice scribes produce basic correspondence; journeyman scribes produce trade contracts and authenticated records; master scribes produce legal instruments, diplomatic scrolls, and complex multi-page documents.

**Mage-scribes** are a distinct specialty — guild-trained scribes who also hold Enchanters' Guild certification. They produce scrolls that carry a stored magical effect (a spell scroll, an enchanted binding contract) in addition to the written content. Mage-scribes are significantly more expensive and primarily used for diplomatic communications, high-value commercial contracts, and magical instruction documents.

**Production time and cost norms:**

| Scroll Type | Scribe Grade | Typical Production Time | Cost per Scroll (AC) |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Basic correspondence (bark paper) | Apprentice | Same day | 0.1–0.3 |
| Trade correspondence (vellum) | Journeyman | 1–2 days | 1–3 |
| Authenticated trade contract | Journeyman/Master | 2–5 days | 8–20 |
| Diplomatic scroll (multi-seal) | Master | 5–10 days | 30–80 |
| Magical instruction scroll | Mage-scribe | 3–7 days | 50–200 |
| Crystal fiber archival document | Master + specialist materials | 1–3 weeks | 120–400 |

**Bran's value-add in scroll processing:**  
Caravans of Fortune does not produce scrolls. The service is **transit, preservation, and intelligent routing** — taking scrolls handed in by senders and delivering them to recipients via the caravan network. Bran's competitive advantage over walking couriers and basic messenger services is: preservation quality across all climate zones, tracking and chain-of-custody for high-value scrolls, and speed-tier options including portal-accelerated express. Bran also provides authenticated intake receipts (a Caravans of Fortune seal indicating condition-at-intake) that have become commercially important for contract dispute resolution — if a scroll arrives damaged, the intake seal establishes whether the damage occurred before or after Bran's custody.

---

### Scroll Senders and Sources

Caravans of Fortune accepts scroll intake at all fourteen operated waypoints plus dedicated intake desks at the six major caravan hub cities. The **intake process** involves: condition assessment, content classification (routine/authenticated/sensitive/diplomatic), sender verification for sensitive and diplomatic tiers, and assignment to the appropriate delivery tier.

**Sender types and volume profile:**

| Sender Type | Volume Share | Typical Classification | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Merchant guild members** | ~35% | Routine to authenticated | Trade contracts, supplier correspondence; high volume, moderate value |
| **Private merchants (non-guild)** | ~20% | Routine | Bulk of bark-paper correspondence; price-sensitive customers |
| **Kingdom authorities** | ~15% | Diplomatic to sensitive | Highest-value contracts; includes postal service contract work (some cities) |
| **Noble houses** | ~10% | Authenticated to diplomatic | Estate management, political correspondence; clients who expect premium handling |
| **Educational institutions** | ~8% | Authenticated | Book and research material transit; Nimbuspire Academy accounts for a significant portion |
| **Enchanters and mage-scribes** | ~7% | Sensitive to magical instruction | Art of Facts uses Caravans of Fortune regularly for Delyra's instruction and component documentation |
| **Private individuals** | ~5% | Routine | Personal correspondence; low margin but high volume in population-dense routes |

**Volume norms:** A standard caravan squad operating a 6–8 week cross-continental route typically carries 200–600 individual scroll items in a dedicated sealed cargo compartment. Diplomatic pouch scrolls are carried in a separate locked box with dedicated accountability chain. High-traffic city-pair routes (e.g., Goldentarn–Nimbuspire) may carry 800–1,200 scroll items per transit.

## Preservation Requirements for Scrolls

### Why Scrolls Degrade

Scrolls face two distinct degradation mechanisms that operate at different rates and require different interventions:

**1. Physical decay** — the substrate itself deteriorates. Vellum is vulnerable to moisture fluctuation (expansion and contraction cycles crack the surface and crack the ink). Bark paper is vulnerable to heat (brittles and yellows within weeks in desert conditions). Crystal fiber parchment resists both but is vulnerable to strong magical interference fields (unusual, but relevant near high-tier portals or Delyra's workshop zones).

**2. Magical information decay** — the enchantment or magical binding carried by a scroll dissipates over time. This can render a spell scroll inert, dissolve a binding contract (catastrophic for legal enforceability), or degrade an authentication seal to the point where it can no longer be verified. Magical information decay occurs independently of physical condition — a scroll can be physically perfect but magically dead. This is the more commercially significant failure mode for high-value scrolls.

**Typical unpreserved lifespan by scroll type:**

| Type | Substrate | Physical Lifespan (unpreserved) | Magical Integrity (unpreserved) |
|------|-----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Basic correspondence | Bark paper | 1–3 years (temperate); weeks (humid/desert) | N/A (no enchantment) |
| Standard vellum contract | Vellum | 10–20 years (dry storage); 1–2 years (transit abuse) | Authentication seal degrades: 1–2 years |
| Diplomatic scroll | Vellum + sealing wax | 15–30 years (dry storage) | Kingdom seal: 2–5 years standard; enchanted seal: up to 10 years |
| Crystal fiber archival | Crystal fiber | 100+ years (undamaged) | Enchantments stable: 10–50 years depending on tier |
| Magical instruction / spell scroll | Vellum (specialist) | 5–15 years | Spell integrity: 6–18 months (Tier 1–2); 2–5 years (Tier 3+) |

---

### Preservation Enchantment Applications

Scroll preservation draws on the same enchantment tier framework established by Art of Facts. The specific applications to scrolls follow the preservation domain (see `enchantment-types-and-magical-craft.md`):

**Tier 1 — Adequate for routine short-transit scrolls:**  
- **Herb Preservation Bundle** (6 AC, 90-day lifespan) — used as a simple passive buffer in scroll storage compartments. The Herb Bundle is not applied to individual scrolls; it is placed in the compartment to passively stabilize the humidity and temperature gradient. Effective for bark paper correspondence on temperate-zone routes. Not adequate for extended transit, climate extremes, or authenticated documents.
- **Cooling Stone** / **Warming Stone** (14 AC, 45 days) — deployed in cargo compartments crossing arctic or desert segments to keep the internal temperature within tolerance. These are caravan-level items applied to the storage space, not individual scrolls.

**Tier 2 — Standard for authenticated documents and cross-climate transit:**  
- **Preservation Barrel** (standard, 55 AC, 180-day lifespan) — the barrel-format item is adapted for scroll transport by Art of Facts as a **Preservation Scroll Case**. A cylindrical variant of the Preservation Barrel enchantment applied to a sealed document case holds 20–40 individual scrolls at stable temperature and low humidity throughout the case's lifespan. At 55 AC per case for a 180-day window, this is the standard handling method for all authenticated and diplomatic scrolls in transit. Caravans of Fortune maintains a standing order with Art of Facts for Preservation Scroll Cases; cases are rotated out at the 150-day mark (30 days before expiry) to ensure the full transit of any scroll intake always occurs within an active preservation window.
- **Healing Salve Vessel** analog — the enchantment principle for keeping compounds at full potency is adapted for **Magical Instruction Seal Maintenance**. A specialized Tier 2 enchantment (produced on commission by Art of Facts) keeps a spell scroll or enchanted binding contract at full magical integrity for transit periods up to 180 days. Unit cost approximately 40–50 AC per scroll.

**Tier 3 — Required for diplomatic and archival transit:**  
- **Preservation Vault** (room-scale, 400 AC, 2-year lifespan) — Bran maintains a Preservation Vault in each of the six major hub facilities. These vaults hold long-term scroll inventory awaiting route allocation, archival copies of high-value contracts, and the diplomatic pouch buffer stock during processing. The Preservation Vault's 2-year lifespan matches the typical storage dwell time for archived material.
- **Long-Range Communication Array** (700 AC, 1 year) — Bran's hub facilities use this enchantment not for scroll transit but for real-time scrying coordination with caravan captains. The Array at the Goldentarn hub connects to a corresponding Array in the Nimbuspire departure zone — the primary hub-to-hub coordination channel.

**Enchantment renewal thresholds (maps to `34-preservation-requirements.csv`):**  
- **Green threshold (>60% integrity):** No action required; scheduled renewal on normal rotation
- **Amber threshold (40–60% integrity):** Next transit assignment triggers a renewal before departure
- **Red threshold (<40% integrity):** Scroll removed from transit chain; held at current location; renewal required before any further movement; sender notified if a diplomatic or authenticated scroll
- **Critical threshold (<20% integrity):** Emergency escalation; magical instruction scrolls and binding contracts treated as potentially compromised; Bran's senior scroll handler makes a judgment call on whether the content can be certified as intact

---

### Climate Zone Interactions

Climate directly drives which preservation tier is required and which routing decisions Bran's squad captains make. The climate zone data from `geography.md` maps to specific scroll handling protocols:

| Climate Zone | Key Kingdoms/Regions | Primary Scroll Risk | Minimum Required Handling |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Arctic/Subarctic** | Nivara, Durnholde, Virellia (winter) | Freezing causes vellum to crack; ink flakes; wax seals shatter | Tier 2 Preservation Case + Warming Stone in cargo compartment |
| **Temperate** | Sylvaran, Underhelm, Gearhame, Drakthar | Low risk; standard dry storage adequate for most durations | Tier 1 Herb Bundle for standard transit; Tier 2 for >60-day routes |
| **Plains/Agricultural** | Solendria, Aurumvale | Seasonal extremes (hot summers, cold winters); dust infiltration | Tier 1 in season; Tier 2 for summer transit across agricultural plains |
| **Desert/Arid** | Siroccane, Cindralis | Heat accelerates ink fade (irreversible within weeks); parchment brittles; bark paper fails within days | Tier 2 mandatory for all scroll types; Tier 3 vault storage at desert waypoints |
| **Tropical/Humid** | Umbros, Fenroth | Worst climate for all scroll substrates; moisture warps vellum, promotes mold, accelerates magical decay | Tier 2 minimum; Tier 3 Preservation Vault for content dwell >30 days; special handling for magical instruction scrolls |
| **Swamp/Wetland** | Bramblewyn, Fenroth | Sustained ambient moisture; similar to tropical but with magical interference from swamp flora | Tier 2; Mild-Interference Protection Seal (specialist Tier 2 add-on from Art of Facts); limited to vellum and crystal fiber — no bark paper accepted |
| **Coastal/Maritime** | Thalassor, Virellia, Seastrand transit | Salt air corrodes authentication seals; salt spray on exposed scrolls is immediately damaging | Tier 2 salt-resistant cases; ship transit uses sealed inner box within Preservation Case |
| **Underground** | Underhelm | Temperature-stable but high ambient magic from deep crystal formations; can interfere with spell scrolls | Crystal fiber preferred for magical instruction content; Tier 2 for vellum; Tier 3 vault storage at Underhelm hub |
| **Floating/Aerial** | Nimbuspire | Altitude creates pressure and temperature variability; magical saturation from the city's lift enchantments can interfere with Tier 1 items | Tier 2 minimum for all content; Tier 3 for incoming diplomatic pouches; Art of Facts proximity makes refresh easy |

**Routing decisions based on destination climate:**  
When a scroll is accepted at intake, the destination climate zone determines the minimum preservation tier assigned. If the shortest route passes through a more hostile intermediate climate, the intermediate conditions govern — a scroll from Goldentarn to Thornmere that passes through Siroccane desert territory requires desert-level handling for the full route, not just the Thornmere destination tier.

Caravans of Fortune's route planning system (`BranMysticalRoutePlanning`) calculates **preservation cost per transit** and can flag a route as "climate-upgraded" when the intermediate zone forces a higher-tier handling requirement than the origin-destination pair alone would require. This data feeds the intelligence-derived route optimization and is a non-trivial factor in route selection — a slightly longer route that avoids a desert crossing may be cheaper to service if the customer has a high proportion of authenticated documents.

**Storage requirements at transit waypoints:**  
All fourteen Caravans of Fortune waypoints maintain a minimum of one active Tier 2 Preservation Scroll Case in stock for scroll transfers. The six major hub facilities maintain Tier 3 Preservation Vaults. Desert waypoints (Akran, the Siroccane crossing post) and tropical waypoints (Mirefen, Umbros agent) require permanent Tier 3 vault storage as documents can dwell at waypoints for 10–30 days during route synchronization.

## Scrying Technology and Intelligence Gathering

### What Scrying Provides

Scrying in a route planning context is **active intelligence gathering** — using magical observation to collect current-state data about conditions along route segments. This is distinct from the passive broadcast infrastructure that supports Rini's tournament coverage. Route planning scrying is query-based: a network operator points a scrying instrument at a defined zone and returns a condition report.

**Types of intelligence gathered via scrying:**

| Intelligence Type | What It Captures | Route Planning Use |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Weather and atmospheric conditions** | Current weather conditions, temperature extremes, storm fronts within 48–72 hours | Departure timing, waypoint scheduling, porter condition assessment |
| **Route hazard assessment** | Physical obstructions (rock falls, flood damage, bridge failures), known threat presence, unusual creature activity | Segment risk rating, route avoidance, guard escalation decision |
| **Creature migration patterns** | Mass movement of creatures through travel corridors | Timing decisions for high-risk segments; dovetails with Weltina's warden data subscriptions |
| **Caravan position verification** | Confirmation of friendly caravan positions for convoy coordination | Convoy scheduling, inter-squad coordination on multi-squad routes |
| **Threat actor intelligence** | Bandit camp activity, territorial disputes relevant to route segments | Threat rating adjustment, guard pricing, insurance rate inputs |
| **Portal gate operational status** | Whether a portal gate is online, currently occupied, or closed | Portal-integrated routing decisions (relevant to Bran's hybrid routes) |

**Accuracy and reliability:**  
Scrying accuracy varies with range, atmospheric magical interference, and equipment tier. Short-range scrying (under 100 km) achieves 85–95% accuracy on weather and physical conditions. Long-range scrying (200–500 km) drops to 65–80% accuracy and is more susceptible to interference. Creature and threat intelligence accuracy is inherently lower (50–75%) because mobile targets can move between the scrying observation and the caravan's transit of the same segment. Bran's route planning system applies confidence intervals to all scrying-sourced data and does not route solely on a single scrying report for high-risk segments.

**Refresh frequency:**  
Standard commercial scrying provides a **daily report cadence** for active route segments. Premium providers offer **twice-daily or on-demand queries** for specific segments. During active caravan operations, Bran's system is configured to trigger a fresh scrying query for the next 48 hours of route at each waypoint check-in. This means a caravan squad leaving a waypoint has scrying data that is at most 24 hours old for the next segment.

---

### Scrying Service Providers

Scrying networks are operated by a mix of kingdom intelligence services (not commercially accessible), guild-operated cooperative networks, and private commercial operators. The commercial market is mature but uneven — quality varies significantly by region.

**Provider types:**

| Provider Type | Coverage | Accuracy Profile | Access Model |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Enchanters' Guild Cooperative Network** | Continental (primary routes only) | 80–90% (weather); 70–80% (hazards) | Annual subscription; priority member access |
| **Regional Commercial Operators** | Single-continent; dense coverage of major trade routes | 75–90% depending on operator | Per-query or monthly subscription |
| **Kingdom Intelligence (licensed sharing)** | Kingdom territory; detailed | 85–95% within territory | Licensed contract; diplomatic relationship required |
| **Independent Mage-Scryers** | Variable; mobile operators hire out per route | 60–85%; highly variable | Per-engagement contract; reliability varies |
| **Nimbuspire Academy Research Network** | Continental; strongest in magical interference zones | 80–90%; excellent for Underhelm and Cindralis | Academic partnership; Bran has a formal data-sharing agreement |

**Commercial scrying service tiers (maps to `33-scrying-service-providers.csv`):**

| Tier | Accuracy % Range | Refresh Cadence | Price Point | Typical Provider |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Basic** | 60–75% | Weekly report | 5–15 AC/segment/month | Independent mage-scryers, lower-tier regional operators |
| **Standard** | 75–85% | Daily report | 20–40 AC/segment/month | Regional commercial operators, Guild Cooperative |
| **Enhanced** | 80–92% | Twice daily | 50–100 AC/segment/month | Top-tier regional operators; Guild Cooperative priority tier |
| **Real-Time (on-demand)** | 85–95% | On-demand + daily baseline | 150–400 AC/segment/month | Kingdom licensed sharing; Nimbuspire Academy partnership; select elite operators |

Bran maintains a **mixed-tier portfolio** across the route network. Critical high-risk segments (desert crossings, mountain passes with avalanche risk, known bandit routes) run on Enhanced or Real-Time tier. Stable, low-risk routes (Goldentarn to Nimbuspire aerial lift; well-traveled Aurumvale plains) use Standard tier. Some very low-use secondary routes use Basic tier and are flagged as "advisory-only" in the route planning system.

**Bran's Nimbuspire Academy partnership** is a meaningful competitive differentiator. The Academy's research network specializes in magical interference zones that defeat commercial scryers — Underhelm's crystal interference, Cindralis's volcanic magical discharge, and the floating Nimbuspire altitude zone. The Academy provides superior data in these zones in exchange for Bran sharing his caravan captain field intelligence (human-observed route conditions) with the Academy's cartography program. This data-sharing arrangement is not publicly known; it is a material advantage for routes through Underhelm and Cindralis.

---

### Scrying as Route Planning Input

Bran's route planning system integrates scrying data at three levels:

**1. Pre-departure route selection:**  
Before a caravan squad departs a major hub, the route planning system consolidates available scrying data across all candidate route segments and produces a **risk-weighted route recommendation**. Each segment receives a composite score from weather risk, hazard presence, threat actor activity, and creature migration status. The system flags any segment scoring above the threshold as requiring captain approval before inclusion in the confirmed route.

**2. In-transit segment updates:**  
At each waypoint check-in, the route planning system triggers a scrying refresh for the next 48 hours. If a segment that was low-risk on departure has elevated since, the captain receives an **alert scroll** (drafted by Bran's hub intelligence staff from the scrying report) and a proposed route amendment. For life-threatening escalations (active armed conflict, bridgeable flood, known creature herd blocking), the captain has authority to deviate autonomously; the amendment is logged back to the system on the next check-in.

**3. Historical scrying data archives:**  
Each completed scrying report is archived with the corresponding route segment, date, and weather/season code. Over time this archive becomes a highly valuable **seasonal pattern database** — allowing the route planning system to predict risk levels for route segments without requiring a current scrying query. Bran's historical archive, which he has been building since Caravans of Fortune's founding, now covers approximately 85% of active route segments with at least 2 full years of seasonal records. This is one of the named competitive advantages in his business overview and is not easily replicable by newer competitors.

**Intelligence consulting revenue:**  
The scrying archive and real-time intelligence access are the foundation of Bran's ~10% intelligence and consulting revenue stream. Paying clients include:
- **Merchant guilds** purchasing route intelligence reports (format: 1-week outlook for a named route) — typically 30–80 AC per report
- **Kingdom governments** purchasing threat briefings on specific regions for military or political planning — 200–600 AC per brief
- **Trading companies** engaging cultural commerce consulting when entering a new kingdom market — ongoing retainer typically 100–300 AC/month
- **Art of Facts (Delyra)** purchasing regular transit-route intelligence for component sourcing routes — covered under Caravans of Fortune's standing partnership agreement with Art of Facts

The intelligence service is deliberately arms-length from the caravan operation. Reports are formatted to be useful to competitors using different carriers — this protects Bran from accusations of carrier bias and makes the intelligence service commercially credible as a standalone product.

## Arcane Mail and Communication Services

### Scroll Routing as a Business

Arcane mail — the transit of physical scrolls through Caravans of Fortune's network — operates on three speed tiers:

| Tier | Description | Transit Time | Price Premium | Requirement |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Standard** | Carried on next scheduled caravan squad traveling the required route | Varies by route; typically 1–6 weeks | Base price (no premium) | Available to all sender classifications |
| **Express** | Priority assignment on the fastest available squad; waypoint transfers accelerated; captain holds at waypoints for minimum time | 30–50% faster than standard | +40–80% on base price | Authenticated or higher content classification required |
| **Portal-Accelerated** | Combined portal gate transit for the long-distance leg + caravan last-mile delivery for destination-city delivery; only viable where portal infrastructure exists | 2–5 days for long-distance leg; standard last-mile | +150–300% on base price; portal gate transit cost adds | Sensitive, diplomatic, or extraordinary circumstances; diplomatic pouches qualify automatically |

Portal-accelerated delivery is not simply "use a portal" — the scroll must be carried by a transit operator to the origin portal hub, transit the gate carried-person (scrolls cannot transit portals unaccompanied), arrive at the destination hub, and then be picked up by Bran's destination-city courier. The total delivery chain requires coordination across three logistics legs. For diplomatic pouches between major hub cities (e.g., Goldentarn to Akran, skipping the desert crossing), this represents enormous time savings and commands corresponding premium pricing. Bran has established preferred-operator agreements with several transit operators who carry diplomatic pouches regularly on the most-used city pairs.

**Tracking and chain-of-custody:**  
All authenticated and above scroll intake includes a **tracking seal** — a light Tier 1 enchantment that allows Bran's hub staff to verify arrival at each waypoint. Sensitive and diplomatic scrolls carry a **break-seal** — if the outer casing is opened between the point of sealing and the recipient's opening, a visible mark appears on the scroll's leading face. Caravans of Fortune does not guarantee the contents have not been read against a break-seal violation, but it does provide written attestation of whether the break-seal was intact on delivery. This attestation is legally significant in most kingdoms' commerce law.

---

### Communication Protocol Context

Scrolls occupy a specific and deliberate position in the communication landscape alongside the Aethernet Information Network (the Nubimancy digital infrastructure) and the crystal communication arrays used for real-time voice over long range.

**Communication method comparison (maps to `23-communication-protocols.csv`):**

| Method | Speed | Permanence | Range | Security | Legal Weight |
|--------|-------|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Physical scroll (standard mail)** | Slowest (days to weeks) | Permanent physical artifact | Unlimited (caravan range) | High (physical custody chain) | Highest — original documents |
| **Physical scroll (express/portal-accelerated)** | Fast (days) | Permanent physical artifact | Unlimited (portal + caravan) | Highest (break-seal + custody) | Highest |
| **Aethernet message** | Near-instant | Digital archive; not inherently persistent | Continental network coverage | Moderate (interception possible in theory) | Not legally binding without scroll confirmation |
| **Crystal communication array voice** | Real-time | Ephemeral unless scribed | Up to 500 km (Tier 3 array) | Low (open transmission) | No legal weight |
| **Direct courier (unenchanted)** | Variable | Depends on content | Local/regional | Low (single-person) | Moderate (witnessed delivery) |

**When scrolls are preferred over aethernet:**
- **Legal documentation** — contracts, agreements, and dispute-relevant records must be in original physical form to be enforceable in most kingdoms' courts. Aethernet transcripts are admissible as supplementary evidence only.
- **Classified content** — diplomatic intelligence, kingdom security communications, and personal financial information are transmitted by physical scroll as a security practice because aethernet is acknowledged to be theoretically interceptable.
- **Magical binding** — any document carrying an enchantment (a binding contract with a compliance ward, a diplomatic seal with a truth-binding clause) must be physical; enchantments cannot be transmitted through the aethernet.
- **Authentication-dependent content** — scrolls with authentication seals (trade contracts, guild certifications, noble grants) derive their legal validity from the physical seal and cannot be replicated digitally.

**Cross-kingdom communication:**  
Diplomatic scrolls between kingdoms follow **protocol hierarchies** that Bran's diplomatic pouch handling service must respect. A kingdom's diplomatic seal on a scroll typically triggers an obligation to carry it sealed and unexamined — Caravans of Fortune accepted this constraint when bidding on kingdom postal contracts and trains scroll handlers accordingly. Violations (breaking a diplomatic seal) would terminate the postal contract and carry personal legal liability for the handler. In practice, Bran's diplomatic pouch handling is the highest-margin and lowest-risk component of scroll mail: the volume is low, the senders don't question the price, and the relationship access (Bran become a trusted logistics provider for kingdom governments) is commercially invaluable for the intelligence consulting business.

---

## Caravan and Scroll Coordination

### Festival Caravan Scroll Logistics

BranCaravanFestivalCoordination operates on a distinct scroll logistics pattern from standard mail. During the 3–4 major annual caravan festivals (harvest market, spring trade fair, Conjunction Dark commercial events, and the Rini-adjacent tournament season), scroll volume increases 3–5× on primary routes as merchants confirm orders, settle accounts, and execute time-sensitive contracts tied to festival vendor terms.

**Festival scroll processing characteristics:**

| Factor | Standard Period | Festival Period |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Intake volume (scrolls/day at major hub) | 80–200 | 300–800 |
| Express tier demand | ~15% of intake | ~40% of intake |
| Authenticated and sensitive proportion | ~25% | ~45% |
| Average content urgency | Low | High — expiry clauses on festival contracts are common |

During festival season, Bran pre-positions additional Preservation Scroll Cases at all major hub facilities (ordered from Art of Facts on a rolling 6-week advance schedule tied to the festival calendar). Hub staff complement is augmented by temporary scribes hired for intake processing. Caravan squads on festival-adjacent routes are scheduled with tighter waypoint windows to support express-tier commitments.

**Rush processing:**  
A **Rush Processing** designation (above Express tier) is available for scrolls where the recipient has a known hard deadline — a vendor contract expiring at close of festival, a bid that must arrive before an auction opens. Rush processing involves hand-carrying the scroll on the next departing squad regardless of squad capacity constraints, and may invoke the portal-accelerated option even for scrolls that would not normally qualify. Rush Processing commands a 300–600% premium over base price and is volume-limited (each hub maintains a maximum daily rush allocation to protect standard service quality).

---

### Route Intelligence Distribution

**Daily intelligence cycle for caravan squads:**  
Each of Bran's twelve caravan squads receives a **Route Intelligence Brief** at every waypoint check-in. During active operations, this brief covers: current scrying data for the next 3 segments, any threat alerts issued since the last brief, migration corridor status from Weltina's warden data feed (where applicable), and portal gate operational status for any portal-integrated segments on the forward route.

| Distribution method | Use case | Pros | Limitations |
|---------------------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Physical scroll (pre-prepared)** | Standard waypoint briefs; forward-staged at waypoints before squad arrival | Permanent record; captain can annotate; works without aethernet access | Must be pre-staged; can't reflect intelligence from the last 12 hours before pickup |
| **Aethernet update** | Urgent alerts, real-time deviation requests, threat escalations | Near-instant; reaches squads with aethernet access instantly | Squads in aethernet dead zones (Underhelm, remote Siroccane, some Sylvaran routes) cannot receive |
| **Crystal array relay** | Emergency-only; life-safety escalations | Real-time voice; most reliable for immediate decision | 500 km range limits; array infrastructure required at squad location; not available in transit between waypoints |

**Scroll-based alert priority system:**  
Pre-prepared route intelligence scrolls carry a **color-code seal** visible without opening: 
- **White seal:** Routine brief, no changes from previous report
- **Yellow seal:** Advisory update — elevated weather risk or mild route condition change; captain to review
- **Orange seal:** Significant change — route segment rating has risen; captain review required before next departure
- **Red seal:** Threat alert — captain must read and confirm receipt by return acknowledgment scroll before transit of affected segment

The red-seal acknowledgment requirement is a legal protection for Caravans of Fortune: it documents that the captain was informed of a known risk before choosing to proceed. In the event of an incident on a red-sealed segment, the acknowledgment scroll is material to insurance claim adjudication.

**Update frequency during active operations:**  
- At each waypoint: fresh brief pre-staged or aethernet-delivered
- Midpoint check (for segments >5 days): aethernet if available, otherwise no update until next waypoint
- Deviation log: captain logs any autonomous route deviation taken since last waypoint; these feed back to the route planning system and update the historical scrying archive with human-observed conditions
