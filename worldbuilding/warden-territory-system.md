# Warden Territory System

**Status:** 🔴 Placeholder — Required for Weltina hero company demo data
**Priority:** HIGH — Warden territories define the operational geography for WeltinaAdvancedCreatureCareProtocols and WeltinaMultiHabitatManagement

## Overview

This document defines the Warden system — the trained specialists responsible for monitoring, protecting, and managing wild creature populations and ecosystems across Nubimancy's regions. Weltina Greensong's businesses depend on warden territories for field operations, habitat siting decisions, and species population monitoring. This document complements `magical-creatures-taxonomy.md` and `creature-materials-processing.md` by providing the operational geography and personnel framework.

## What Is a Warden?

### Role Definition
- **[To be completed]** — Core warden responsibilities (territory patrol, population census, threat response, habitat assessment)
- **[To be completed]** — Distinction from sanctuary staff (wardens operate in the wild; sanctuary staff operate in managed facilities)
- **[To be completed]** — Warden authority within their territory (enforcement powers, conservation permits)

### Specializations
- **[To be completed]** — General Warden (broad territory coverage, multi-species)
- **[To be completed]** — Species Specialist Warden (deep expertise in one species group)
- **[To be completed]** — Conservation Warden (focused on endangered species and habitat restoration)
- **[To be completed]** — Combat Warden (handles dangerous creature containment and threat response)

### Training and Certification
- **[To be completed]** — Warden Guild structure and rank progression
- **[To be completed]** — Required species expertise certifications per territory
- **[To be completed]** — Combat and emergency response qualifications

## Territory Structure

### Territory Classification

- **[To be completed]** — Territory risk levels (Low / Medium / High / Extreme — maps to `68-warden-territories.csv`)
- **[To be completed]** — Seasonal availability variations (some territories inaccessible in certain seasons)

### Territory Governance
- **[To be completed]** — Who grants territory authority (kingdom, conservation guild, international treaty body)
- **[To be completed]** — Contested territories (political implications from kingdoms-and-politics.md)
- **[To be completed]** — Multi-kingdom territories and jurisdictional rules

### Territory-Habitat Relationship
- **[To be completed]** — How Weltina's managed habitats relate to adjacent wild territories
- **[To be completed]** — Buffer zone definitions between managed and wild zones
- **[To be completed]** — Wild population monitoring as input to sanctuary population management

### Emergency Response
- **[To be completed]** — Threat response protocols (dangerous creature encounters, population crises)
- **[To be completed]** — Escalation chain from territory warden to Weltina's central operations
- **[To be completed]** — Emergency evacuation procedures for managed habitats near wild threats

### Data Reporting
- **[To be completed]** — What warden field reports contain

## Conservation and Population Management

### Population Thresholds
- **[To be completed]** — What triggers conservation status escalation (links to `63-species-profiles.csv` critical threshold)
- **[To be completed]** — Warden authority to halt harvesting if population drops critically
- **[To be completed]** — Breeding program triggers and warden involvement

### Genetic Diversity Monitoring
- **[To be completed]** — How genetic diversity is assessed in the field
