# Warden Territory System

**Status:** 🟡 Framework — Core structure established; individual territory profiles and migration corridor detail can expand in data planning
**Priority:** HIGH — Warden territories define the operational geography for WeltinaAdvancedCreatureCareProtocols and WeltinaMultiHabitatManagement
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

## Overview

Wardens are the field professionals who make Haven Wildlife Preserve's broader mission possible. They operate in the wild — patrolling territories, conducting population censuses, managing harvesting operations, and coordinating emergency responses to creature crises. They are distinct from sanctuary staff, who work inside Haven's managed facilities; wardens work in the territories where creatures actually live.

The warden system is also one of Weltina Boons' most commercially valuable contributions to the Fivefold Oaths network: warden-collected migration and territorial data feeds directly into Bran Brightwood's route planning, and warden-overseen harvesting produces the ethically certified materials that Delyra's Art of Facts relies on for premium enchantment components.

## What Is a Warden?

### Core Role

A warden holds territorial authority over a defined geographic zone — a recognized mandate to monitor, protect, and manage the wild creature populations within that area. This is not just descriptive work; wardens have operational authority that sanctuary staff do not:

- **Harvest oversight**: Wardens authorize and supervise all ethical harvesting operations within their territory; no permitted harvesting proceeds without warden sign-off
- **Emergency authority**: A warden can halt active harvesting if population data indicates a critical threshold has been crossed
- **Anti-poaching enforcement**: In most kingdoms, a guild-certified warden has legal standing to report poaching incidents with evidentiary weight; in kingdoms with active conservation law (Aurumvale, Virellia), they hold limited enforcement powers including right to detain pending kingdom authority arrival
- **Territory data ownership**: The census records, migration logs, and population assessments a warden produces for their territory are the primary data source for conservation planning

### Warden vs. Sanctuary Staff

These roles are complementary and sometimes overlap in experience (many wardens start as sanctuary staff), but they are operationally distinct:

| | Warden | Sanctuary Staff |
|--|--------|----------------|
| **Operating environment** | Wild territories, open habitats, contested terrain | Haven's managed facilities and enclosures |
| **Primary work** | Census, patrol, harvesting oversight, emergency response | Species care, habitat maintenance, medical treatment, education tours |
| **Creature interaction** | Observational and supervisory; minimizing intervention | Direct care relationships; handling trained and conditioned animals |
| **Mobility** | Field-mobile; covers large areas | Facility-based |
| **Key risk** | Environmental hazard, dangerous creature encounters | Managed risk within facility safety protocols |
| **Data output** | Population estimates, migration corridors, territorial maps, threat logs | Individual creature health records, feeding logs, behavioral assessments |

Sanctuary staff can be deployed to territories for specific operations (coordinating creature transfers, establishing new managed habitats); wardens can rotate through sanctuary roles for knowledge development. But at Haven, the two tracks have distinct guild certifications and career ladders.

## Warden Guild: Ranks and Certification

The Warden Guild is one of the older field-practitioner guilds, predating Haven's existence. Weltina works with the existing guild structure rather than building a parallel one — this gives her instant professional legitimacy and access to a trained labor pool. She serves on the Guild's Conservation Council, an advisory body that was expanded to include non-territory operators after her advocacy during the post-plague recovery.

### Rank Structure

| Rank | Certification | Responsibilities |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Apprentice Warden** | Basic Field + First Species Endorsement | Supervised territory patrols; mentored census work; no solo harvesting oversight authority |
| **Field Warden** | Full Field + Three Species Endorsements + Emergency Response | Solo territory assignment; full census authority; harvesting oversight within assigned territory; first responder for creature incidents |
| **Senior Warden** | Multi-Territory + Specialist Track Endorsement | Manages two to three adjacent territories; mentors apprentices; coordinates with other field wardens on shared threats |
| **Conservation Specialist** | Senior + Conservation Science + Breeding Protocol | Endangered species focus; breeding program design and oversight; inter-territory population management; Weltina's field research partners |
| **Territory Marshal** | Conservation Specialist + Regional Governance + Guild Council | Regional oversight across multiple Senior Wardens; kingdom-level negotiation authority; guild representative in territorial disputes |

### Compensation (Calibrated to Canon Wages)

*Baseline reference: common laborer 0.6 AC/day (216 AC/year); skilled craftsperson 1.2 AC/day (432 AC/year). Warden work is skilled, dangerous, and field-mobile — compensation reflects the risk premium.*

| Rank | Annual Compensation | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Apprentice Warden** | 200–350 AC/year + housing/meals | Typically housed at Haven or a regional field station |
| **Field Warden** | 500–800 AC/year | Territory stipend adds 50–100 AC/year for remote or high-risk postings |
| **Senior Warden** | 1,000–1,500 AC/year | |
| **Conservation Specialist** | 1,200–2,000 AC/year | Research partnership contracts with Nimbuspire can supplement |
| **Territory Marshal** | 1,800–3,000 AC/year | |

### Species Endorsements

Species endorsements are certifications for safe field interaction with specific creature families. A warden without the appropriate endorsement cannot legally conduct harvesting oversight for that species — not because the law prohibits it, but because the Warden Guild's chain-of-custody certification is only valid when signed by an endorsed warden.

Major endorsement categories:
- **Draconic** (Drake, Wyvern; True Dragon requires separate elevated certification)
- **Ethereal** (Unicorn, Celestial Stag, Phoenix — rarely assigned)
- **Elemental** (Fire Salamander, Ice Spirit, and planar variants)
- **Aquatic** (Coastal and deep-water species)
- **Forest** (Dryad, Treant, and associated species)
- **Avian & Aerial** (Flight-capable creatures of all families)
- **Subterranean** (Cave-dwelling and deep-earth species)

A Field Warden with three endorsements covers the species profile of their assigned territory. Senior Wardens and above typically hold five or more.

## Territory Structure

### Classification by Terrain

Warden territories are primarily classified by terrain type, which determines the knowledge base, equipment, and species endorsements required to operate in them effectively.

| Terrain Type | Examples | Key Species | Operational Challenges |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------------------|
| **Ancient Forest** | Sylvaran Enclaves, Mistwood Border | Dryads, Treants, Celestial Stags, forest predators | Limited visibility; druidic governance; slow seasonal change but high magical sensitivity |
| **Mountain / Highland** | Durnholde, Drakthar borderlands | Drakes, Wyverns, alpine predators | Seasonal inaccessibility; weather extremes; mining conflict zones |
| **Volcanic / Geothermal** | Cindralis volcanic zones, Ashford outskirts | Fire Salamanders, juvenile fire-plane elemental creatures | Heat management; sudden activity events; proximity to industrial operations |
| **Glacial / Arctic** | Nivara glacial territories | Ice Spirits, frost-plane creatures | Climate instability affecting species baseline; isolation from support |
| **Wetland / Marsh** | Fenroth, Bramblewyn swamp zones | Aquatic creatures, swamp predators | Navigation difficulty; alchemical harvesting pressure from Thornmere |
| **Underground / Subterranean** | Deep territories near Underhelm, cave systems | Cave species, subterranean species, deep-earth elementals | Complete portal isolation in most zones; Underhelm political sensitivity |
| **Coastal / Maritime** | Thalassor coast, Virellia island territories | Aquatic species, coastal creatures | Merfolk diplomatic handling; sea weather; jurisdiction edge cases at sea boundary |
| **Transitional** | Border zones, plains-forest edges | High ecological diversity; migration-focal | Multiple terrain skills required; often contested governance |

### Risk Classifications

Risk level determines staffing requirements, response protocols, and the safety infrastructure wardens are expected to maintain. Ratings map to `68-warden-territories.csv`.

| Risk Level | Definition | Staffing Minimum | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Low** | Stable, well-mapped territory; predominantly non-dangerous species; no contested jurisdiction | Single Field Warden; Apprentice support optional | Temperate farmland edge territories; stable coastal zones |
| **Medium** | Active migration corridors; moderate creature danger; some jurisdictional complexity | Paired Field Wardens; Senior oversight quarterly | Mountain foothills; mixed forest-agricultural borders |
| **High** | Apex predator territory; critically endangered species requiring intensive monitoring; contested jurisdiction; known poaching pressure | Senior Warden required; dedicated emergency response contact; minimum quarterly Territory Marshal review | Drake nesting ranges; unicorn groves; Ashen Marches contested zone |
| **Extreme** | Active volcanic or planar influence; highly dangerous creature populations; military conflict adjacency; cross-kingdom legal ambiguity | Senior Warden + specialist endorsement; regular safety check protocol; never solo operation | Cindralis deep volcanic zones; active contested border territories; any territory with True Dragon presence |

### Seasonal Availability

Several territory types have defined inaccessibility windows that affect census scheduling, harvesting oversight, and emergency response routing:

| Territory Type | Inaccessible Window | Reason | Operational Impact |
|--------------|--------------------|---------|--------------------|
| High-altitude mountain | 3–4 months (mid-winter) | Snow closure of passes | Pre-season census conducted in early autumn; no harvesting oversight during closure |
| Glacial/Arctic | 2–3 months (deepest winter) | Extreme temperature and whiteout conditions | Ice Spirit assessments shifted to spring emergence windows |
| Volcanic zones (active periods) | Variable; 4–12 weeks per activity cycle | Eruption risk | Warden withdrawal protocol triggered by early warning signs; predictive scheduling based on historical cycles |
| Deep underground | No seasonal closure, but restricted during Underhelm political periods | Political access, not seasonal | Negotiated access windows; Weltina manages personal relationship with Underhelm's Council of Wardens |

---

## Territory Governance

### Authority Sources

Territory authority is not universally granted by a single body. It depends on who controls the land:

| Territory Type | Granting Authority | Process | Weltina's Standing |
|--------------|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Within a kingdom's claimed land** | Kingdom's conservation authority (where one exists) or crown license | Formal application; Warden Guild certification required; kingdom-specific review | Varies; strong in Aurumvale, Virellia, Sylvaran; more complex in isolationist kingdoms |
| **Unclaimed wild territories** | Warden Guild self-governance; no kingdom asserts authority | Guild territory registration; peer review | Standard professional standing |
| **Sylvaran Enclaves** | Druidic Circle of the relevant enclave | Relationship-based; druidic assessment of the applicant's conservation ethics | Trusted; one of few outsiders granted deep-forest access rights |
| **Contested border zones** | Joint agreement required from all claiming parties, or operate under Warden Guild conflict protocol | Complex diplomatic process; slow | Fivefold Oaths neutral status helps; Bran's diplomatic relationships used in some cases |
| **Underhelm underground** | Underhelm Council approval per territory, per season | Formal diplomatic arrangement | Tolerated; Weltina's conservation record is respected even where Underhelm culture is wary of outside authority |

### Contested Territory Complications

Several territories of high ecological significance fall within politically contested regions:

**Ashen Marches** (Underhelm/Cindralis border): Drake nesting grounds cross both kingdoms' claimed zones. Harvesting oversight requires dual sign-off. Population census data is treated as diplomatically sensitive by Underhelm. Haven's position: census data is scientific record, not a political claim — this remains an ongoing negotiation.

**Mistwood Border** (Sylvaran/Aurumvale edge): Ancient forest species straddle the boundary. Sylvaran druidic circles have informal primacy over deep habitats; Aurumvale asserts formal conservation authority over any commercial harvesting. Haven operates under a joint protocol that Weltina negotiated personally: Sylvaran druid approval required for access; Aurumvale documentation required for any commercial component collection.

**High Siroccane Desert Ranges**: Wyvern territories with no fixed kingdom oversight. Siroccane nomadic groups have traditional hunting rights in these zones that predate any guild framework. Haven has working relationships with several nomadic groups and operates by customary permission rather than formal territory authority.

## Patrol and Census Operations

### Population Census Methodology

Census work is the core quantitative output of warden field work. For most species, a warden conducts:

- **Seasonal visual count**: Direct sighting observations during known activity periods; recorded by territory zone and compared to prior seasons
- **Sign census**: Tracks, nesting sites, territorial markings, and feeding evidence when direct observation is difficult; particularly important for subterranean and nocturnal species
- **Territory mapping update**: Boundary changes noted annually; breeding ground additions/losses tracked
- **Health quality assessment**: Observation of visible condition indicators — coat/scale/feather quality, movement patterns, foraging behavior. Sick or stressed populations are flagged even if count numbers are stable

Census data flows into `63-species-profiles.csv` and drives the conservation tier assessments in `magical-creatures-taxonomy.md`. A three-season declining trend triggers automatic escalation to Conservation Specialist review.

### Patrol Scheduling

Field Wardens establish patrol routines calibrated to their territory's ecology:

| Territory Activity Level | Patrol Frequency | Key Periods |
|------------------------|----------------|------------|
| Low-activity stable territory | Bi-weekly patrol; monthly full-territory sweep | No particular peak |
| Migration focal territory | Weekly during migration windows; monthly baseline | Pre and post migration season |
| Breeding ground territory | Daily proximity monitoring during breeding season; weekly outside | Breeding season (species-specific) |
| High-threat territory | Weekly minimum; triggered supplemental patrols on threat indicators | Year-round elevated |
| Emergency status | Continuous coverage until resolved; additional warden deployed | Per event |

Scrying network integration (commercial scrying alerts for unusual creature activity, weather events) supplements direct patrol — wardens subscribe to regional scrying service feeds as a supplemental alert layer.

### Data Reporting and BC Integration

Warden field reports feed into Haven's BC system on a defined schedule:

- **Weekly**: Sighting log, patrol coverage report, any active incidents
- **Monthly**: Zone-level population estimate update, harvesting quota status, health assessment summary
- **Seasonally**: Full population census tabulation; migration corridor update; territory risk level review; quota recommendation for coming season

These reports populate the active fields in `68-warden-territories.csv` (territory status and last census) and `63-species-profiles.csv` (population estimates and trend direction). The migration corridor records in `73-migration-corridors.csv` are updated twice yearly — pre-season prediction and post-season confirmed path.

---

## Migration Corridor Management

### What a Corridor Is

A migration corridor is a mapped movement path used by a species population during seasonal transit between habitats — breeding grounds, winter ranges, water sources, and forage zones. Corridors are not fixed in the way territory boundaries are; they shift with population pressure, habitat change, and year-to-year ecological variation. Wardens update corridor maps to reflect observed route shifts.

Corridor data is one of Haven's most commercially valuable data products:

- **Bran's Caravans subscribes to quarterly corridor updates** as a primary route safety input. Routes that cross active migration paths require seasonal adjustment or protective scheduling; failure to account for a wyvern migration path has historically resulted in significant cargo losses.
- **Settlement safety briefings**: Cities near active corridors pay for advance migration timing alerts, particularly for apex predator populations.
- **Ecological research**: Corridor shift data is the primary indicator of habitat pressure — movements that were stable for decades and then shifted suggest human-activity impact upstream.

### Corridor Protection During Active Migration

When a population is actively moving through a corridor, Haven's operational standard is:

- **Commercial harvesting suspended** in the active corridor zone for the duration
- **Bran's route planning receives 72-hour advance notice** of corridor activation; standard caravan routes are flagged for deviation
- **Emergency response pre-positioned** for the corridor zone; large migrations of apex species get a Senior Warden dedicated for the duration
- **Industrial activity reporting**: Adjacent kingdoms are notified for any corridor that crosses into their claimed territory

### Cross-Territory Corridor Governance

A migration corridor that passes through multiple warden territories requires coordination between the wardens holding each section. The Senior Warden with the largest population segment in their zone coordinates; if the corridor crosses kingdom lines, the Territory Marshal for the region chairs communication. This is one of the most practically complex parts of Haven's field operations.

## Harvesting Oversight

### The Warden's Role in Ethical Harvesting

No ethical harvesting operation certified by Haven can proceed without an active warden present or an authorized warden sign-off on a pre-approved protocol. This is not bureaucratic formality — it is the mechanism that makes Delyra's certification chain and Weltina's material auctions meaningful. A Delyra auction lot certified as ethically sourced carries a warden's name, territory assignment, and Guild certification number as part of its provenance record.

### Quota Enforcement

Seasonal harvesting quotas — total permitted extraction volume per species per territory per season — are set by Haven's Conservation team in consultation with the relevant Territory Marshal. They appear in `72-harvesting-quotas.csv`. Wardens enforce these quotas actively:

- Running total is tracked per harvesting event; warden records each collection against the quota
- When a territory hits 80% of seasonal quota, the warden files an alert to Haven's Conservation team for review before further collection
- The warden has unilateral authority to **invoke a quota hold** if field-observed population conditions suggest the quota estimate was too high for the current season — this overrides the pre-set number pending review

### Emergency Halt Authority

A warden's most significant unilateral power is the emergency harvest halt. Triggers:

- Census count falls below the conservation threshold floor for the species in that territory
- Unusual population stress indicators observed (massed departure, visible disease, breeding failure signs)
- Environmental disruption that affects the accuracy of the quota estimate (unusual predator activity, habitat damage event)

An emergency halt suspends all active harvesting operations in the territory immediately. It triggers a Conservation Specialist review within 5 days. If the halt is sustained, it initiates a full population reassessment and potential multi-season quota suspension. Wardens who invoke emergency halts are reviewed for accuracy — incorrect halts cost everyone commercially — but a warden who fails to invoke when warranted faces the more serious professional consequence.

### Chain of Custody Documentation

Every ethical collection event generates a documentation record:

1. **Pre-collection**: Species, estimated individual, territorial zone, harvest method, expected yield
2. **Collection**: Actual yield, warden signature, date/time, condition notes
3. **Transfer**: Handoff to Haven's material processing team; counter-signature
4. **Authentication**: Delyra's Art of Facts certification appended for commercial-grade components
5. **Final record**: Lot number assigned; enters auction or standing-order inventory

This chain appears in Haven's BC system as item tracking from origin (warden territory) through processing to sale. Multiple heroes can query their segments: Bran sees transit records if material ships via his routes; Delyra sees authentication records; Weltina's finance team sees auction pricing.

## Emergency Response

### Threat Categories

| Threat Type | Definition | First Response |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Creature Danger** | Apex or dangerous creature outside expected territory boundary in proximity to settlement | Field Warden + Senior Warden; creature relocation assessment; alert to affected settlement |
| **Population Crisis** | Census data indicating sudden sharp population decline; signs of mass disease or injury | Conservation Specialist dispatched; emergency harvest halt invoked; Weltina briefed directly |
| **Poaching Incident** | Evidence of illegal harvesting, trapped or killed individuals, illegal equipment | Field Warden documents and preserves evidence; escalates to kingdom authority; Warden Guild incident report; Weltina's anti-poaching contacts activated |
| **Habitat Emergency** | Significant habitat damage event — fire, mining collapse, flood, magical disruption | Senior Warden assesses habitability; refuge protocol activated if population needs relocation |
| **Corridor Incident** | Migration route blocked or disrupted; population diverted into dangerous zones | Warden coordinates with settlement and route authorities; Bran's Caravans notified if route intersection; routing advisory issued |

### Escalation Chain

1. **Field Warden** → identifies incident, initiates first response, files immediate report to Haven
2. **Senior Warden** (same region) → notified within 4 hours for High/Extreme incidents; coordinates multi-territory response
3. **Territory Marshal** → notified for any incident requiring kingdom authority contact or multi-kingdom coordination
4. **Weltina directly** → Population crisis events, significant poaching events, or any incident with Fivefold Oaths cross-hero implications

For creature danger events near settlements, response time matters commercially — cities that have contracted Haven's emergency response service (a warden services revenue line) expect a response within 24 hours for standard proximity incidents.

## Strategic Intelligence Value

### Bran's Caravans Intelligence Feed

Bran's route planning operation is one of Haven's largest standing-contract customers for warden-derived intelligence. The relationship works because warden data and route planning have natural alignment:

| Warden Data Product | Bran's Use | Delivery |
|--------------------|-----------|---------|
| Quarterly migration corridor update | Route deviation planning; seasonal route adjustments | Quarterly report via arcane scroll service |
| Creature territory boundary maps | Risk scoring for route segments | Annual update; ad hoc when significant shift occurs |
| Active migration alerts | 72-hour advance route advisory | Triggered; immediate via scrying communication crystal |
| Unusual activity reports | Hazard scoring for active squads | As-occurrence; daily digest during active incidents |

This data is priced as a standing subscription, not per-incident. Bran's 12 caravan squads collectively represent a significant safety value-add that the subscription more than justifies economically.

### Settlement Safety Contracts

Cities adjacent to high-activity territories pay Haven for seasonal briefings on expected creature activity near their perimeter. This is a direct revenue line managed by the relevant Territory Marshal and priced based on territory risk level and species present:

- Low-risk agricultural zone annual brief: 30–80 AC/year
- Medium-risk frontier settlement: 80–200 AC/year
- High-risk proximity to apex habitat: 200–500 AC/year
- Emergency response contract (guaranteed warden response within 24h): 300–600 AC/year additional
